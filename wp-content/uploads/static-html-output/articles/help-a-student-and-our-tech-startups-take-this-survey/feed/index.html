					<description><![CDATA[&quot;high tech&quot; seems to mean only software to most people in Bend, going by the articles found here.
As a &quot;high tech&quot; electro-mechanical packaging engineer, with a few decades of experience, spending the last year trying to transfer my successful career into the Bend &quot;high tech&quot; scene, I wish it was a bit more balanced, albeit for selfish reasons.  The argument I will give though has a basis.   Hardware related related &quot;high tech&quot; could be a boon to giving Bend a diverse high-tech pool of workers, bringing in a need for  Electrical/mechanical/quality engineers, technicians, skilled assemblers, in addition to software.  And tends to employ more than the couple of people employed in the average software startup.  A medium sized high-tech hardware company would be easy to set up in Bend as a Design Center, and I am sure SisTech wouldn&#039;t mind expanding to support final assembly.  The heavy industry processes for hardware companies is generally done elsewhere, keeping them an appropriately green addition to the Bend scene.  Garmin is an example of the toe-in-the-door for a company of this type moving into Bend.    Meanwhile, I will just keep hoping, and knocking on the doors of the slim pickings available in Bend at the moment.]]></description>
