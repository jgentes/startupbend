					<description><![CDATA[Python is popular, but sadly it&#039;s not the most employable skill.  It reminds me of COCC classes that recently taught Microsoft Access classes (begging the question &quot;but why?&quot;)

Look at the job postings on the right.  Lots of .NET jobs, some PHP, Ruby, and Node.js.  No Python.  OSU-Cascades might consider at least teaching in a syntactically similar language to what is employable, such as Java, javascript, or C#.  

Point being to exploit what&#039;s employable here in the USA for higher paid jobs, vs. what is being used in third world countries where your skills compete with $10/hour code minions.]]></description>
