					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/why-i-left-amazon-and-started-a-company-in-bend/#comment-21&quot;&gt;Ken Waletzki&lt;/a&gt;.

KEN!  

Hey there; it&#039;s Jon-Paul Baumer from Austin, MN.  AHS class of 1977, a couple years before you graduated.  I think we played in the AHS orchestra together?  You were also friends with the Beck family, if I&#039;m not mistaken.

I&#039;m preparing for the Iowa Summer Writer&#039;s Festival and have been working on a piece for publication, which I might be presenting next month if I can finish it in time.  Your brother Danny makes a brief appearance in the piece; he and I were acquainted in 1968 for about a year.

I&#039;d like to send you an email with a handful of questions; if you would be at all interested.  I&#039;d like to learn a little about his &quot;fast &#038; furious&quot; mindset.  

You might not want to discuss Danny with me.  If that&#039;s the case, I will understand.  

Hope to hear from you either way.  Thanks in advance.

Jon
Le Sueur, MN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had a similar experience.  I Left Intel in the South Sound several years ago.   We now call Bend home.   Now, I have a startup that is fast becoming very fun!

We haven&#039;t completely bailed on Seattle.  We still have a townhouse in Magnolia we use a few months a year (definitely July and August most years!) and rent out as a short-term furnished rental the remainder of the time.  I still do all of our favorite activities with our Seattle friends like climbing in the  Cascades, rock climbing at Leavenworth, trail running at Tiger and across the street at Discovery Park, and the I-90 hikes.  And there&#039;s all the great ethnic food that you just can&#039;t get in Bend.

We love calling Bend home, but with some good extended trips to the Emerald City it is, perhaps, like &quot;eating my Paseo&#039;s pork sandwich and having it too.&quot;]]></description>
