			thirty (30) days            from StartupBend's notice to you thereof;
            provided that, StartupBend can terminate the Website immediately as part of a general shut

            </strong></li>

            express or

            or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence,

            action. StartupBend shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond
            their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
        </li>
        <li><strong>General Representation and Warranty.</strong> You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the
            Website will be in strict accordance with

            and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in
            your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and
            including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States
            or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Website will not infringe or misappropriate the

            you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an
            authorized executive of StartupBend, or by the posting by StartupBend of a
            revised version. Except to
            the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website
            will be governed by the laws of the state of Oregon, excluding its conflict of law provisions,
            and the proper
            venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts
            located in Deschutes County, Oregon. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or
            claims regarding
            intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond),
            any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive
            Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three
            arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in
			Bend, Oregon, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be
            enforced
            in any court.
            The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and
            attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed
            to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A
            waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one
            instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights
            under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions;
			StartupBend may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement
            will be binding
            upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

    <h2 id="atospp-privacy" class="auto-tos-pp ppheading">Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>StartupBend LLC ("<strong>StartupBend</strong>")
        operates StartupBend.com and may operate other websites. It
        is StartupBend's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
        while operating our websites.</p>
    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>Like most website operators, StartupBend collects non-personally-identifying information of the
        sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
        referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. StartupBend's purpose in
        collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
        how StartupBend's visitors use its website. From time to
        time, StartupBend may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
    <p>StartupBend also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
        (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on StartupBend.com        blogs/sites. StartupBend only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
        commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
        where the comment was left.</p>
    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>Certain visitors to StartupBend's websites choose to interact
        with StartupBend in ways that require StartupBend to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that StartupBend gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a href="/">StartupBend.com</a> to provide a
        username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with StartupBend are asked to
        provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
        process those transactions. In each case, StartupBend collects such information only insofar as
        is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
		StartupBend. StartupBend does not disclose personally-identifying information
        other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
        the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
    <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
    <p>StartupBend may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
        websites. StartupBend may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
        However, StartupBend does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
        described below.</p>
    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>StartupBend discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
        only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
        in order to process it on StartupBend's behalf or to provide services available
        at StartupBend's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
        of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
        using StartupBend's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to
        them. StartupBend will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
        organizations, as described above, StartupBend discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
        when StartupBend believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
        property or rights of StartupBend, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
        user of an StartupBend website and have supplied your email address, StartupBend        may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
        date with what's going on with StartupBend and our products. If you send us a request (for
        example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
        clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. StartupBend takes all
        measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
        provides to the website each time the visitor returns. StartupBend uses cookies to
        help StartupBend identify and track visitors, their usage of StartupBend        website, and their website access preferences. StartupBend visitors who do not wish to have
        cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
        using StartupBend's websites, with the drawback that certain features
        of StartupBend's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>If StartupBend, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event
        that StartupBend goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
        assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
        any acquirer of StartupBend may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this
        policy.</p>
    <h3>Ads</h3>
    <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
        These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
        compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
        other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
        Policy covers the use of cookies by StartupBend and does not cover the use of cookies by any
        advertisers.</p>
    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, StartupBend may change
        its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in StartupBend's sole
        discretion. StartupBend encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to
        its Privacy Policy. If you have a StartupBend.com account, you might also
        receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in
        this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
