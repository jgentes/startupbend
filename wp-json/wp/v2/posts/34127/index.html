This blog continues a series of selfies + blogs about the amazing people she\u2019s met in the last couple of years. #julieselfie<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I first met Pam Stevenson, local startup strategist, pitch coach and founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awesomefoundation.org\/en\/chapters\/bend\">Awesome Bend<\/a>, in 2013 during my first Bend Venture Conference. An astute strategist and accomplished athlete, Pam has contributed much to the Central Oregon Community. I caught up with her and her dog Sprocket one recent September morning for a \u201cboard\u201d meeting on an SUP on the Deschutes River.<\/em><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34128\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34128\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-34128\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1698.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Harrelson, Pam Stevenson and Sprocket. \" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" data-wp-pid=\"34128\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1698.jpg 640w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1698-500x375.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34128\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie Harrelson, Pam Stevenson and Sprocket.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How many years have you been in Bend and what key changes have you seen in the entrepreneurial community?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sixteen years ago, I quit my dream job to live in my dream place.\u00a0 There weren\u2019t a lot of job opportunities, so I had to create my own.\u00a0 I started my own consulting business and my first client was a little startup called Ruffwear.\u00a0 I became the General Manager and we squeezed eight employees and all our inventory into a 1,500 square foot building in the Old Mill.\u00a0 I also began teaching entrepreneurship at another little startup called OSU-Cascades.\u00a0 We had one building on the COCC campus and all six of the graduating business majors took my class because it was the only elective.<\/p>\n<p>Back then, university entrepreneurship programs in general were just starting to come onto the scene and Bend\u2019s entrepreneurial eco-system hardly existed. In 2004, I joined a volunteer board led by Dan Hobin and Karen Fast that launched the Bend Venture Conference.<\/p>\n<p>After that, I became a pitch coach, working with many of the presenting companies at BVC. The BVC has grown to be the largest angel conference in the Pacific Northwest deploying over $1 million in capital. Now Bend has an angel fund, a venture capital fund, several co-working spaces and a thriving entrepreneurial community.\u00a0 And this year, OSU-Cascades will be launching its new campus and the Innovation Center for Entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>Another major change I have seen is on the river, where I live. When I first moved here, hardly anyone floated the river.\u00a0 Now, on a hot summer day, we reach flows of 500+ FPH (floaters per hour). The crowds have included unicorns, pizza slices and a ferret on a paddleboard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What drives you to be involved and give so much back to our community?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The incredible people of Bend are what make this my home. Over the years, I have witnessed several friends become disgruntled with the growth and change and decide to move to the \u201cnext Bend.\u201d Fernie, B.C., McCall, ID, Steamboat Springs, CO, even Maui.\u00a0 Everyone moved back, thankfully.\u00a0 Bend may not be perfect, but it can still be awesome if we don\u2019t take it for granted and we stay involved.<\/p>\n<p>One and a half years ago, I launched Awesome Bend. Every quarter we hold a Pitch Night where five finalists vie for $1,000 to do something that helps make Bend more awesome. I like to call it \u201cShark Tank for community good.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ve got 10 generous trustees who chip in the cash and we usually fill the room with people who leave inspired to come up with their own ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As an athlete, what core principles do you think apply to success in business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Years ago, I started the Bend Adventure Racing Klub (BARK).\u00a0 There are so many great analogies between adventure racing and business\u2014teamwork, navigation, strategy, preparation, determination.\u00a0 But this Olympics marked the 20th anniversary of the Golden Shoes, so to answer that question I\u2019ll share my story that I posted recently:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>The Golden Shoes<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I met my soul mate, at the age of six<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Just down the road at the rubber plant.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Floppy blue canvas uppers with gum rubber soles.<\/em><br \/>\n<em>PF Flyers!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Scraped my elbows, bruised my knees,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Even got a black front tooth. <\/em><br \/>\n<em> But, in my PF Flyers <\/em><br \/>\n<em> I ran like the wind, I jumped over the moon.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Run, skip, hop, fly, dream.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> \u201cMom, I\u2019m going to the Olympics!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>PF Flyers were my gateway sneakers.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Converse All Stars<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Puma cleats<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Waffle Racers\u2026<\/em><br \/>\n<em> I\u2019d loiter at the Athlete\u2019s Foot<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Just to ogle the aglets and grope the grommets.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> And dream Five Ring dreams.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Off to college. <\/em><br \/>\n<em> Blew out my knee on the hockey field.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Graduated and sent a letter to Nike.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> \u201cNo Thanks,\u201d they said.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> Went home to visit.<\/em><br \/>\n<em> \u201cMom!
