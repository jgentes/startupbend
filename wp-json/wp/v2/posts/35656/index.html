LuDela is hosting a meet-and-greet happy hour Thursday 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Tech Center Thump followed by product demos and a slideshow.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ludela.com\/\">LuDela<\/a> founder Jamie Bianchini recently relocated to Bend from Nevada, and brought his fledging social venture business with him. He&#8217;s created a real-flame, scent-on-demand decorative candle that has a wireless remote control ignition, extinguish, timers and extensive safety features. (Related: Are <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/spurred-by-giant-order-fireside-audiobox-now-ready-for-mass-production\/\">we becoming the world hub of remote-controlled flame products<\/a>?)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35658 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ludela-1-438x500.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"438\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The inspiration for LuDela came while Jamie was on a tandem bike ride around the world. According to the LuDela news release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In a small village in West Africa, about half way through a global tandem cycling expedition, Jamie woke up to a terrifying scene\u2014a room filled with smoke from a candle fire in his room.\u00a0 Luckily, Jamie was able to put the fire out and nobody was hurt.\u00a0 Little did he know, that event would become a defining moment of the global tour and the stimulus for a promising social venture called LuDela that recently relocated its headquarters to Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The day after that fateful candle fire Jamie was cycling a lonely road in Burkina Faso when he was hit with a vision of a totally innovative new way to experienced real-flame candlelight.\u00a0 This revolutionary new candle design uses embedded technology to create the safest, most convenient and truly hassle free real-flame candle experience in the world.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-35659 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/head-shot-very-small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"445\" \/>Jamie notes while he was riding in Africa, the first thing kids that he met asked him for was books. So, connecting the dots here, he decided that for every LuDela candle sold, the company will donate a book to an underserved community.<\/p>\n<p>LuDela\u2019s first \u201cbook drop\u201d will be in February in Uganda, at the Good Hope School, which was founded by a Ugandan rider who rode on Jamie\u2019s bike back in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>The company has already taken flight on Kickstarter. Its crowdfunding campaign,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1960836911\/ludela-perfect-scented-real-flame-remote-controlle\"> which you can still contribute to<\/a>, has raised $27,275 &#8212; well past the original $20,000 goal. Jamie is currently in fundraising mode, aiming for a spot in the early stage competition of the Bend Venture Conference.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s already raised a total of $1.4 million, which he used to create and develop the product.<\/p>\n<p>Jamie is serial entrepreneur and a graduate of USC&#8217;s entrepreneurship program. He&#8217;s also the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/abicyclebuiltfortwobillion.com\/\">A Bicycle Built for Two Billion<\/a>, and visited Bend in 2015 as part of a tour for that book.<\/p>\n<p>Back to Thursday&#8217;s event. Jamie mostly wants to meet the community and introduce LuDela to Bend. He and his wife are making internationally inspired appetizers. There will be drinks available. And he plans to demo the candles and then host a slideshow of the his 81-country tandem bike expedition.<\/p>\n<p>LuDela Open House<br \/>\n4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Happy Hour<br \/>\n6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Slide Show<br \/>\nThump @ The Tech Center<br \/>\n1001 SW Emkay Drive<br \/>\nBend, Ore.<\/p>\n<p>Questions?
