Last fall Rob Little, <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50startups-cairn-introduces-outdoor-enthusiasts-to-new-products\/\">founder and CEO of Cairn<\/a>, was pitching his newly started subscription box for outdoor lovers at PubTalk and the BVC. His startup is now shipping more than 10,000 boxes &#8212; and seeing double-digit growth &#8212;\u00a0 each month.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur referral network is really strong, and we\u2019ve hit our stride with social media,\u201d Little says. Many subscribers pay months in advance, a model that gives the company some nice cash flow. That\u2019s allowed Little to hire five people &#8212; most recently bringing on a second\u00a0marketing person.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31611\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31611\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_092659.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31611\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_092659-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Little, founder of Cair, at the 2014 BVC. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_092659-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_092659-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_092659-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31611\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rob Little, founder of Cair, at the 2014 BVC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There\u2019s certainly some competition in the subscription box market. (We may be reaching Peak Box any moment.) But from the beginning, Little has envisioned his company as providing data and market analysis to the companies that place products in Cairn boxes in addition to sending subscribers fun packages.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to drive review rates on our products in excess of 30%,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, Little says he sees Cairn evolving into a company rooted in both the outdoor and technology industries, one that utilizes data and transforms it into a revenue stream. For now, the company is trying to gain as many subscribers as possible.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32901\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32901\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MG_1613.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32901\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MG_1613-500x385.jpg\" alt=\"A Cairn box filled with goodies. \" width=\"500\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MG_1613-500x385.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MG_1613-1024x789.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MG_1613-800x616.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Cairn box filled with goodies.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Cairn\u2019s rapid growth has also required the startup to make some changes from how it did business in its first year.\u00a0 The most significant is that the company recently moved the work of packing and sending its boxes from Bend to\u00a0Connecticut.\u00a0 \u201cAs our numbers continue to grow, we no longer have the time or bandwidth to pack here in Bend,\u201d Little says.
