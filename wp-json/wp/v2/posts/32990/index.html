As of today, our blog will now be <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\">StartupBend<\/a>. For the past year, we\u2019ve been working hard to tell the world about both the growing tech <em>and <\/em>startup community in this most favorite place we call home. Beyond giving us the opportunity to print up some cool new stickers, we believe StartupBend better reflects the range of stories we\u2019ve been telling (especially via the <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-steadybudget-closes-seed-round-hires-devs-and-sales\/\">#50startups project<\/a>) and opens the blog up to a wider audience of startup lovers, supporters, founders, employees and more.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to create a home for all of Central Oregon\u2019s startup activity, from tech and outdoor gear to food products and bioscience. Meanwhile, the BendTECH coworking space will continue to provide a place where people can work, meet other professionals, collaborate on big things and maybe drink a little beer. You can find information about BendTECH coworking at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendtech.com\">BendTECH.com<\/a> and via @BendTECH on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Now three things to know about startupbend:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You get more news.<\/strong> You know when companies raise their prices and reduce their services and then try and tell you you\u2019re actually getting more? That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. We still plan to provide you with all sorts of startup news and the<a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/dogsofstartups-sage-odysys-doesnt-do-business-casual-ok\/\"> occasional #dogsofstartups <\/a>photo. In addition to continued tech coverage, we\u2019ll also provide more stories from Bend\u2019s other lively startup sectors. And of course it\u2019s free.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You get more jobs.<\/strong> We hope that even more employers will take advantage of our <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/jobs\">jobs board<\/a>. You can now search it by sector. We\u2019ve received an overwhelming positive response from both employers posting on the board and from people applying. People are finding jobs because of the board. It\u2019s like magic. And that warms the cockles of our hearts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re the best.<\/strong> We couldn\u2019t keep doing what we\u2019re doing without the people who read this blog, follow us on social media, send us emails with story ideas and generally love startups as much as we do. We all know that Bend is special. We\u2019re firm believers that the startup community here is too. And as long as there are people willing to take big risks to follow their dreams, build something that positively impacts this place we live and love and generally fight the good fight, you can read about \u2018em right here.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We\u2019d also like to extend a big thanks to Tierney O\u2019Dea, manager of the BendTECH coworking space, for her support and help during this transition, as well as for her blogging. And we&#8217;re eternally grateful to <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.us8.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=71976cd07e82503f3b35a91fc&amp;id=95d9d6e086&amp;e=2942f1f8a0\">BendBroadband<\/a> for its continued support of the blog and Central Oregon startups.<\/p>\n<p>Now who wants a SUB sticker?
