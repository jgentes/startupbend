Since its founding four years ago, the Bend-based B-Corp has sold beautiful clothes, and in the process provided employment, job training and funds to women in India who are escaping sex trafficking.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Sudara story started when I came home from my second trip to India in 2005 and set out on a mission to end sex slavery for women and children. What started as a non-profit to provide jobs and vocational training to empower women to escape sex slavery in India, has grown into the Sudara we know now \u2013 a certified B-Corp operating out of Bend, Oregon with vocational centers across India,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.sudara.org\/india-or-bust\/\">writes founder Shannon Keith<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sudaragoods\/videos\/2019050471724984\/\">Watch Shannon&#8217;s facebook live video here for more details.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is now transferring its operations to India, in order to create more jobs, open the company up to a global market and create a sustainable business for the future. To do so, however, t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sudara.org\/collections\/all-products-excluding-donations\">hey need to liquidate their Oregon inventory.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Sudara has launched an &#8220;India or Bust&#8221; sale &#8212; with all of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sudara.org\/collections\/all-products-excluding-donations\"> its inventory marked down by 51%<\/a> (to honor women, who make up more than half of the global population). The sale runs through the end of March, and the company anticipates shipping its spring line from India by May. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shannon and her company have truly lived and breathed what it means to be a B-Corp and leverage business to do good in the world. This move is a next big step, and not an easy one to make. But the potential results are so positive&#8211;more jobs in India, and Shannon says in the U.S. (more on that later) and a bigger impact toward the Sudara cause, which is empowering women to escape the sex trade. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"325\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2019-03-18-11.26.54-1-1024x325.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36061\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2019-03-18-11.26.54-1-1024x325.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2019-03-18-11.26.54-1-500x158.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2019-03-18-11.26.54-1-768x243.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2019-03-18-11.26.54-1-480x152.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s good stuff.
