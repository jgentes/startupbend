The event was sold out with nearly 500 people attending, and the startup vibe was contagious. To top things off, our beloved past Venture Catalyst and Tech Alliance president, Jim Coonan, delivered the opening presentation.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33389\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33389\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-33389 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coonan-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Coonan presenting at RAIN Eugene event.\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coonan-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/coonan-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jim Coonan presenting at RAIN Eugene event.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>An interesting aspect to RAIN is that they support a wide range of industry segments. Startups included everything from bicycles (bikefriday.com), to margarita mix that was really damn good (lolasfruitshrubs.com), distilled spirits (swallowtailspirits.com) and fancy leather notebooks (bullandstash.com).<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33390\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33390\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33390\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot_6-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Lumidax Bakerboard Analog Trainer\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33390\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lumidax Bakerboard Analog Trainer<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>On the tech side, they showcased a biotech firms NemaMetrix (nemametrix.com) and Miracle Query. Software included a restaurant rewards program called KlubHub (klubhub.com), a restaurant employee training product (waitrainer.com) and on the hardware side, a product that helps students learn STEM using a really compact all-in-one electronics \/ oscilloscope kit (lumidax.com).<\/p>\n<p>And while the conference was certainly the highlight of the trip, I was also able to spend some time with Mark Davis from CodeChops (codechops.com), a coworking space for tech professionals in Eugene. Mark organized a meeting with some of the leaders in the local startup community, and even provided pizza (what a guy). If you need a cool place to work in downtown Eugene, this is the place to be.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33391\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33391\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33391\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/PANO_20150505_122042-500x170.jpg\" alt=\"CodeChops Coworking Downtown Eugene\" width=\"500\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/PANO_20150505_122042-500x170.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/PANO_20150505_122042-768x260.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/PANO_20150505_122042-1024x347.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33391\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CodeChops Coworking Downtown Eugene<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>And to top it all off, I spent some time with Shula Jaron, the executive director of Fertilab Thinkubator, a local biotech accelerator. They&#8217;re moving into a new location right up the street from CodeChops and already had NemaMetrix\u00a0in there working on important-looking research using microscopes and other gear. Very cool stuff. I can&#8217;t wait to head back there, and I hope that we can create a bridge of some sort between their startup ecosystem and ours in Central Oregon. We have a lot in common, and I believe both communities could benefit from sharing resources and\u00a0supporting the growth of startups across the entire state.<\/p>\n<p>To wrap it up, I created a quick snapshot of the startup community that I was able to tap into, and I hope it piques your interest in visiting Eugene and connecting with some of these organizations:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33392\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33392\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33392\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot_7-500x339.jpg\" alt=\"Eugene Startup Ecosystem\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot_7-500x339.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot_7-768x520.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot_7.jpg 799w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eugene Startup Ecosystem<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week,\u00a0RAIN Eugene held their &#8220;State of the Startup Ecosystem&#8221; address, where they highlighted the latest companies emerging from their [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":33392,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33388"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=33388"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33388\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":33412,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33388\/revisions\/33412"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/33392"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=33388"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=33388"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=33388"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
