The company employs nearly 100 people around the world, with offices in Bend, Japan, France, England, Berkeley, Ohio and soon Germany. CEO Ron Fritz is now aiming to grow a development team here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think this is a great time to begin adding to our tech talent,&#8221; Ron says.<\/p>\n<p>More on that in a moment. But first, <a href=\"http:\/\/techsoft3d.com\/company\/about-us\/\">Tech Soft 3D does really cool things<\/a>. In addition to creating the 3D technology that underpins the PDF standard, the company also provides software development tools that help software teams create all sorts of 3D engineering applications for manufacturing, architecture, engineering and construction, metrology, geospatial, mining and more.<\/p>\n<p>From the company&#8217;s website:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We\u2019re pleased to say that partners using our tools include industry leaders such as Adobe, Autodesk, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, Trimble, 3D Systems, Bentley and ANSYS as well as exciting start-ups such as GrabCAD and Lagoa. In fact, many of today\u2019s respected industry applications partnered with Tech Soft 3D in their start-up phases, including products from SolidWorks, SpaceClaim, ANARK, ARAS, IronCAD, Synchro and Gehry Technologies.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Though the company has been in Central Oregon for almost a decade, Ron deemed <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/originally-based-in-berkeley-tech-soft-3d-names-bend-headquarters\/\">Bend Tech Soft 3D&#8217;s official headquarters last year<\/a>. The company has since added several positions to its Bend office, which currently houses members of its executive team, marketing and sales, as well as many people on the operations side.<\/p>\n<p>Next up: Bringing on a <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/jobs\/view\/software-engineer-full-stack\/\">Bend-based\u00a0software engineer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Because this is the corporate headquarters, we don&#8217;t want to get too disconnected from where the rubber meets the road in terms of the products we create,&#8221; Ron says. Currently, most of Tech Soft 3D&#8217;s product development staff are in its Berkeley, Calif. and Lyon, France offices.<\/p>\n<p>Christa Summers, the company&#8217;s director of people development, notes that recruiting for tech talent in the Bay Area is challenging, not only because of the local competitors, but also because of commuting challenges and the high cost of living.<\/p>\n<p>The Bend office, which is just across from the new OSU-Cascades campus, now has about 15 people and is growing. &#8220;Everybody here really embodies our company values of having fun and building relationships, being agile and responsive, and striving for excellence,&#8221; Christa says. &#8220;We work hard, but we also have a lot of fun. It&#8217;s an amazingly smart group of people who are really excited about what they do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Sm2DtG7zw2I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>They also travel all around the world. And play corn hole in their office. Sound like a place you want to work? Ron says that they&#8217;re not looking for someone with a specific number of years of experience, but instead focused on a hire who has the core skills down.
