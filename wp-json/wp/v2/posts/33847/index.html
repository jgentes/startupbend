The two companies pitching are none other than DohJe, founded by Amanda Krantz, and Zealios, co-founded by Austin Britts.<\/p>\n<p>DohJe means &#8220;Thank You&#8221; in Cantonese and is a gratitude platform that makes it easy for patients to thank nurses, doctors and other healthcare providers. Sidenote: You might have seen Amanda pitch <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/meet-dohje-a-gratitude-platform-that-helps-patients-thank-caregivers\/\">DohJe <\/a>at the unConference prior to last year&#8217;s BVC. At that point she was contemplating moving here and checking out the community via the conference. Now she&#8217;s a Bendite and we&#8217;re pumped about it.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33583\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33583\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33583\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Amanda-Krantz-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda Krantz, CEO of Dohje. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Amanda-Krantz-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Amanda-Krantz.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33583\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amanda Krantz, CEO of Dohje.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The second company, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/new-to-bend-personal-products-startup-zealios-targets-triathletes\/\">Zealios<\/a>, is a personal products company that targets the triathlete market. Not to give away the farm, but the products are zinc-based and made for high performance. Britts, too, is a recent addition to our fine city &#8212; and also my neighborhood.

It&#8217;s like a Bend startup-palooza.\u00a0Dan Hobin, co-founder and CEO of G5, will deliver the keynote address.\u00a0Darren Powderly, co-founder and VP of business development for <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/crowdstreet-closes-3-5-million-series-a-funding-round\/\">Crowdstreet<\/a>, which was a\u00a02014 Bend Venture Conference finalist, will provide a company update.

If you haven&#8217;t checked out Sudara: Do it. So many cute pants plus an awesome cause. I haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of interviewing Shannon yet, but I&#8217;m hoping to soon.<\/p>\n<p>So per usual, PubTalk will probably sell out. And you don&#8217;t want to be that sad person at the door, just hoping to get into DA CLUB only to be bounced out onto the sidewalk. (I go to a lot of dance clubs, as you can tell). Don&#8217;t be that person. <a href=\"https:\/\/edcoinfo.com\/events\/may-pubtalk\/\">Buy a ticket in advance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/10NzUoOcKhf2xy\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"club\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">This guy.
