Looks nice, but he&#8217;s also ninja when it comes to online privacy.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Putting it out there<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Howell explains that what we think is locked down is often still available to <em>dirt bags<\/em> searching inside of social media networks (versus searching Google). They can then use that information to steal your identity and create fake profiles in your name, with all sorts of bad intentions such as scamming people for money. Even more alarming: Howell notes that fake friends &#8212; people who have friended you with malicious intentions &#8212; are common, and of course, they have access to everything you post.<\/p>\n<p>At the core of Hueya\u2019s first product is a vulnerability scan, which assesses how much of the information that you believe is private and\/or shared only with friends is actually available to black hatters lurking on your social media channels. The scan produces two fascinating &#8212; and possibly unsettling &#8212; results. The first is \u201cyour story,\u201d a detailed narrative of your life pieced together via social media postings that strangers can find.<\/p>\n<p>A recent Hueya scan of one of Howell&#8217;s friends revealed the names, ages and birthdays of his friend\u2019s children, the name of his wife, where they lived, their children\u2019s elementary school and even the fact that he liked skiing and biking. \u201cHackers and people attempting to steal your identity have access to all of that with one click,\u201d Howell says.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your privacy score<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nThe second result of the scan is a privacy score &#8212; a number between 0 and 500 that functions like a credit score. A score on the higher end means your Internet information is locked down tight, while scores under 400 mean you\u2019re at some level of risk. Hueya then provides users with steps they can take to improve their score. \u201cIt\u2019s about what you\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d Howell says.<\/p>\n<p>Howell is still working with his team to finalize a second MVP. As of now, he\u2019s aiming to create a SaaS model that allows individuals to scan and then regularly monitor their Internet privacy. Future versions of the product could be used at an enterprise level for compliance and other data security purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Howell came to Bend via Boulder, a veteran of the first Internet boom. Hueya is currently bootstrapped and Howell plans to raise a pre-seed round from family and friends. He\u2019s worked at several startups and tech companies. He\u2019s now applying lessons learned to his own &#8212; and hoping to help people take back some of their online privacy in the process.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point with online culture in which we believe we\u2019ve lost the right to our own information,\u201d he says. &#8220;At Hueya, we are empowering users to reclaim their online privacy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hueya.life\/\">Hueya <\/a>(pronounced Who-Ya)<br \/>\n<strong>Founded:<\/strong> November 2015<br \/>\n<strong>Founder:<\/strong> Lewis Howell, former vp of IT for G5<br \/>\n<strong>More info:<\/strong>\u00a0Check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hueya.life\">Hueya blog <\/a>and Twitter account for information and thought leadership on privacy, online security and you.<br \/>\n<strong>Something to note:<\/strong>\u00a0Hats off to G5 for not just being an anchor of the tech and startup community, but for spinning out other startups, including Hueya and <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-steadybudget-closes-seed-round-hires-devs-and-sales\/\">Steady Budget<\/a>.
