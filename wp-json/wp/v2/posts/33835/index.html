Sarah is an entrepreneur and CEO of Pacific SuperFoods, a healthy, vegan snacks company, which she founded Portland and relocated to Bend. Seems like we\u2019ve known each other for a long time. Sarah has a tireless optimism, a strong work ethic and wears great hats. In our recent conversation, I was reminded of a New York Times article where Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Gloria Steinem that she liked her rap name-\u201cNotorius RBG\u201d and relayed to Steinem that by searching an online rap name generator she found that Steinhem\u2019s rap name is Glo-stick. Hence, I present you with a conversation between Sarah P. Slam and Julie aka Queen Ritz.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Julie: What are a couple of key things you&#8217;ve learned in the last 2 years?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sarah: How bad you want &#8216;it&#8217; + how willing you are to dedicate your effort towards achieving it = the predominant formula that determines success. It&#8217;s those things that don&#8217;t make us blink when the inevitable challenges of business arise, and the things that drive us &#8212; necessarily &#8212; to find ways to be more innovative, smarter, and quicker.\u00a0One of the most fun aspects of building a great business is building a great team and witnessing the different ways people show up in big and often unexpected ways to help drive the business forward. I can wholeheartedly say our people have made all of the difference. Lastly, ensuring our financials are the hub of our decision-making. The better grip we have, the better decision-making, the greater longevity.<\/p>\n<p><em>J: What are three things you are looking forward to in the next 2 years?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>S: We are entering one of the most exciting times in our company as we place a huge emphasis on and investment in new product innovation. We just launched a food incubator here in Bend (in a new space downtown), where we are solely focused on developing revolutionary products. Our primary emphasis is in the arena of healthy snacking; for example, can we make a Twinkie healthy? We are experimenting with every type of plant that exists, with the aim of bringing as many truly healthy, truly delicious snacks to the market.<\/p>\n<p><em>J: What is one thing you would suggest to someone starting a business?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>S: Just do it. Really, the worst that could happen is the business doesn&#8217;t work out (which your ego and bank account can recover from). But the rewards on the flip side are innumerable. My favorite,\u00a0the opportunity to offer a product or service that positively impacts others&#8217; lives.<\/p>\n<p><em>J: How many hats do you have?\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>S: Ha! I am always on the quest for the &#8220;perfect&#8221; hat, but I only have about 3 hats at any given time. Once I find a perfect hat, I wear it out. I currently have more hats than I&#8217;ve had in years, because I&#8217;ve gone through about 7 of our signature &#8220;Kale&#8221; hats, and have kept all of the worn out ones.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Julie Harrelson, CEO of the Harrelson Group and manager of Cascade Angels, has a beloved penchant for taking selfies with [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":33836,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6],"tags":[69],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33835"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=33835"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33835\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":33838,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33835\/revisions\/33838"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/33836"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=33835"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=33835"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=33835"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
