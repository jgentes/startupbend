Head to Hack Night Bend"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);\">If it&#8217;s been your dream to meet an autonomous robot, well you&#8217;re in luck. The next Hack Night, scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 5, will feature a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.turtlebot.com\/\">Turtlebot2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);\">From the Hack Night Invite:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);\">(Turtlebot2) is an autonomous robot programmed with ROS,\u00a0which uses a Microsoft Kinect as a \u201cfake laser\u201d (technically an RGB-D, \u201cD\u201d for distance, camera) to implement SLAM\u00a0(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);\">SLAM is a fancy way of saying that Turtle2 can autonomously move from one place to another without running into things &#8211; even in unfamiliar environments. ROS takes ridiculously difficult mathematical algorithms and turns them into a language mere mortals can understand (C++ or Python) which can then run on a basic computer. With ROS, you can program Turtle2 to move across a room, avoid obstacles and position it centimeters from a given point, all with a couple of lines of code. It\u2019s pretty amazing. If you\u2019re remotely interested in robotics, come check it out.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);\">Smartwaiver hosts Hack Night, and the monthly event usually attracts 30 to 60 people. Mark Silliman, the evening&#8217;s host, recommends that people RSVP, though it&#8217;s not required. The goal of Hack Night is to:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);\">&#8230; bring together tech\u00a0entrepreneurs (current or inspiring), devs of all languages, engineers, gamers, artists (graphics or other), UX \/ UI junkies, nerds, geeks, hackers (both software and hardware), folks interested in the \u201cinternet tubes\u201d and playing with technology under one roof. Gatherings will be held once a month and anyone that fits the above criteria is invited.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s no structure, presentations or agenda. Just good conversation about the topic at hand, and perhaps some intense foosball. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/hack-night-bend\/events\/215207402\/\">See the full invitation here<\/a>. Then go get your robot on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If it&#8217;s been your dream to meet an autonomous robot, well you&#8217;re in luck.
