The firm launched in 2013 with the goal of helping to fill the regional capital gap facing PNW, and particularly, Oregon-based startups. The first fund, which totaled $7.5 million, invested in multiple Oregon startups, including Bend-based Manzama, and Portland-based CrowdStreet and Bright.md.<\/p>\n<p>Founder and Managing Director Dino Vendetti noted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/seven-peaks-ventures-corrals-28-million-to-accelerate-startup-growth-in-pacific-northwest-and-western-us-regional-startup-hubs-300711934.html\">via a news release<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the past five years, we&#8217;ve worked hard to claim a spot for\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">Oregon<\/span>\u00a0on the map as a viable hub for capital and a great place to start a business. In that time, we&#8217;ve expanded our team, advisors and events portfolio to provide the highest level of coaching and support to entrepreneurs in the Northwest and beyond in other dynamic Western U.S. markets.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Dino told Geekwire that he was on the front-end of investors who were interested in looking beyond Silicon Valley as place to launch and grow tech companies. Many then were skeptical that startups could thrive outside of major metropolitan areas, and especially outside the hub of startup and tech activity that is the Bay Area. (Indeed I recall interviewing people in 2013 and 2014 for stories and talking to investors who viewed an Oregon zip code, especially a Bend one, as a deterrent).<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35680\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35680\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35680\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SevenPeaks_photo-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SevenPeaks_photo-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SevenPeaks_photo.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Seven Peaks team from left to right: Dino Vendetti, Dave Parker, Tom Gonser, Corey Schmid, Tony Abena, Matt Abrams, and Joe Franzi.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s been some noticeable progress in this area over the past five years, and Seven Peaks has certainly helped lead the charge, highlighting the potential and opportunity found in Oregon startups. &#8220;Today my VC friends from Silicon Valley don\u2019t say we are crazy nearly as often \u2014 I take that as progress,\u201d Dino <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2018\/seven-peaks-ventures-raises-28m-fund-will-invest-25-early-stage-startups-across-pacific-northwest\/\">says in the Geekwire piece<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While the VC firm has grown its fund size, it has also increased its partner ranks.
