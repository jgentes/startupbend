Survey Asks STEM Employers About Hiring Needs"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re a Central Oregon employer or HR manager looking for employees with STEM skills, then we&#8217;ve got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/s\/C8HKGDM\">survey<\/a> for you. There&#8217;s a local effort underway aimed at improving and increasing our pool of potential hires who have science, technology, engineering and math skills.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re in a bit a talent crisis, and that&#8217;s a critical concern for a region that wants to bolster its current STEM industries and encourage more of those employers to come here. But before the efforts to tackle this problem get seriously underway, employers and people in the STEM industries need to pipe up and identify what types of programs, skills and jobs are needed to prepare our students for success.<\/p>\n<p>Hence <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/s\/C8HKGDM\">the survey<\/a>. Did we mention the survey? If you have 10 minutes of time, it&#8217;s definitely worth your while.<\/p>\n<p>The coalition behind this effort, founders of the Central Oregon STEM Hub, are also hosting a STEM Hub Gap Assessment Focus Group Tuesday from noon to 1:30 p.m. at McMenamin&#8217;s in Bend.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re looking for hiring managers or employers who anticipate needing to hire employees with STEM skills in the next five to 10 years.
