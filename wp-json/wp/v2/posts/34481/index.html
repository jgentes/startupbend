The makeup contains no chemicals or toxins, as well as no ingredients that have been tested on animals.<\/p>\n<p>A devoted animal lover, Ericka volunteers at the Brightside Animal Center in Redmond every Sunday, and also fosters kittens and rabbits. The young entrepreneur has layered her ethics into every aspect of her company. For example, the packaging of the lipstick is sustainably sourced, using paper from a woman-owned recycled paper boutique in Bali.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe gift inherent in these boxes is that\u00a0their production helps trash reduction on the island,\u00a0a growing concern as its population and popularity continue to rise,\u201d according to Axiology\u2019s website. Axiology also donates a portion of its profits to conservation and animal rights organizations including PETA and local humane societies.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-34483\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2017-02-21-12.56.38-500x274.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2017-02-21-12.56.38-500x274.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2017-02-21-12.56.38-768x421.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2017-02-21-12.56.38-1024x562.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2017-02-21-12.56.38.png 1285w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Coming to Bend<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ericka and her partner, Eric Dubs, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/bend-based-dubslabs-kickstarts-on-ear-flat-headphones-which-allow-you-to-hear-your-surroundings-and-music-while-skiing-biking-and-more\/\">another local entrepreneur<\/a>, left Bali and went back to New York.
