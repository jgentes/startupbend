Harrelson, who splits her time between Bend and Portland, says the fund is quickly being recognized as a viable effort in the Pacific Northwest. The average investment is between $50,000 and $200,000.<\/p>\n<p>Harrelson says the angels are looking for launch stage companies that are already earning revenue, as well as good ideas that need funding to get off the ground. And the investments aren\u2019t limited to tech, though the capital efficiency of tech startups is appealing, Harrelson notes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe consider the strength of the opportunity,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>As the fund\u2019s first manager, Harrelson hit the ground running last fall, rounding up both investors and seeking out investment opportunities. \u201cI wanted to get from phone number to fully funded as soon as possible,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The fund doesn\u2019t plan to compete with other local or state-wide investors, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/sevenpeaksventures.com\/\">Seven Peaks Ventures<\/a>, a Bend-based VC, but instead finds ways to collaborate. Case in point: <a href=\"http:\/\/cascadeangels.com\/droplr-investment-May-2014\">Cascade Angels\u2019 investment in Droplr was joined by Seven Peaks and the Portland Seed Fund<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Harrelson herself is no stranger to startups. She\u2019s worked for a few and started two of her own companies. She served in varied positions including CEO, VP, and VP of Sales, and she\u2019s currently head of the Harrelson Group, a management consulting firm. (In her<\/p>\n<p>spare time, Harrelson also sits on the advisory board of the OSU Advantage Accelerator).<\/p>\n<p>The Pacific Northwest-native spent a considerable amount of time in Bend over the years and was intrigued by the region\u2019s percolating startup scene. With Cascade Angels, she is now a player in it as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a big difference in activity here just in the past 12 months,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time here&#8211;there\u2019s lots of efforts coming together to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With its first fund launched last March, Cascade Angels plans on making a $120,000 investment in the upcoming Bend Venture Conference, says Julie Harrelson, the fund\u2019s manager.
