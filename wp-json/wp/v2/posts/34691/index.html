The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.outfoundseries.com\/\">inaugural OUTFOUND Series<\/a>, slated for June 9 through June 11, combines an outdoor business expo and startup competition with social and recreational activities.

First up: Matt Smith, founder of Bend-based<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tribepilot.com\/\"> Tribe Pilot<\/a>, was selected to pitch his startup as part of the event&#8217;s pitch competition, organized in partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/bendoutdoorworx.com\/\">Bend Outdoor Worx<\/a>, Bend&#8217;s own outdoor startup incubator.

A serial entrepreneur and Bend native, Matt created the adventure planning tool as a way to help people better organize group outings and trips (instead of the dreaded 75-email thread that includes all the important details about what to bring in email 27).<\/p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tribepilot.com\/\">Tribe Pilot website:<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Tribe Pilot is an adventure planning tool that makes it easier to get outdoors with your friends and family. Group trips are typically organized and executed via e-mail exchanges. Trip details gets buried in the banter, important emails get missed, and time is wasted searching through hundreds of emails to find the important stuff. Our mobile application acts as a trip dashboard, compiling critical trip details in one location. You\u2019ll always have easy access to the content you care about like trip dates, locations, pack lists, and which meal you signed up for. Foster great adventures through effortless trip planning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The app is set to launch in late summer of this year. In the meantime, you can follow Tribe Pilot on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tribepilot\/\">Instagram<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tribepilot\/\"> Facebook<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tribe_pilot\">Twitter<\/a> for updates. We&#8217;ll also be wrangling Matt for a more in-depth interview on his company soon. Watch out.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to BOW and Tribe Pilot, other Bend business leaders will take the stage at the OUTFOUND festival. Rob Little, co-founder and CEO of Cairn is one of the scheduled speakers. The event will feature presentations from a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.outfoundseries.com\/event\/talks\">\u00a0host of outdoor industry leaders that include<\/a>s the founders of Cotopaxi, Oiselle, Olukai and The Dyrt, as well as professional athletes and more. It looks to be an awesome weekend, and a great chance for the Oregon outdoor industry to highlight its best and brightest as well as the next generation of outdoor startups.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hood River will be hosting an adventure sports and outdoor innovation festival next week, and a host of Bend speakers, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":34692,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,63],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34691"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34691"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34691\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":34695,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34691\/revisions\/34695"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34692"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34691"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34691"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=34691"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
