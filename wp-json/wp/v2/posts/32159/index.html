And Dumas (previously w\/ Internmatch, Dice and Monster) is not joking. The company&#8217;s platform, which connects brands to an ever-ready college &#8220;whurkforce,&#8221; introduced the first version of its mobile app this week.<\/p>\n<p>The mobile app is ready for beta testing by college kids looking to earn some quick cash &#8212; or gift cards and other swag &#8212; by completing jobs for companies wanting to market on college campuses. For example, Silipint used <a href=\"www.whurk.com\">whurk <\/a>last fall to hire students to distribute their sili shot glasses to the social chairs of sororities and fraternities at several colleges.<\/p>\n<p>Colin Morrison, the company&#8217;s vice president of product development, says that most of the mobile app&#8217;s bugs have been worked out, and they&#8217;re now primarily seeking feedback on the app&#8217;s usability. Beta testers simply need to complete a few whurkorders, get paid and then give their two cents on how the app worked.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #545454;\" align=\"left !important\">whurk launched last November and was piloting the program with some local Bend brands. Now the company has &#8220;whurkers&#8221; on more than 200 campuses. The startup is also moving into office space in the Old Mill soon.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31821\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31821\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Whurk-Premier.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31821\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Whurk-Premier-500x397.jpg\" alt=\"whurk founder Rob Dumas and VP of Product Development, Colin Morrison at the Blitz to the Barrel in Bend last summer. \" width=\"500\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Whurk-Premier-500x397.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Whurk-Premier-1024x813.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Whurk-Premier-800x636.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31821\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">whurk founder Rob Dumas and VP of Product Development, Colin Morrison.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"color: #545454;\" align=\"left !important\">\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The founder of whurk Rob Dumas said recently that the Bend-based startup has been moving at &#8220;startup pace&#8221; since we [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[15,6],"tags":[52],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32159"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32159"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32159\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32176,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32159\/revisions\/32176"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32159"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32159"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32159"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
