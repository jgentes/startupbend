As part of the fun, we asked people to send in a short explanation of why they should win a ticket to BVC. The entries were fantastic and truly showcased our Central Oregon startup community &#8212; with emails coming in from early-stage startup founders, new entrepreneurs in town, recent college grads and more.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Our friends at Cascade Angels had the hard job of choosing a winner. They were so moved by the number and substance of the entries, they ended up awarding not one, but two BVC tickets, and one ticket to PubTalk. The winning entries, and comments from the Cascade Angels team are below. Thanks to everyone who participated; we&#8217;d love to meet all of you at PubTalk, BVC, unConference or simply around town.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>The Cascade Angels BVC Ticket Giveaway winners are &#8230;<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><strong>Taylor Kimberly<\/strong><\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/LRG__DSC6369-e1506359034588-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From Cascade Angels: &#8220;We loved the creativity of this entry, which was presented in the form of a pitch deck.
