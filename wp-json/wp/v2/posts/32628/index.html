We are investors. We are mentors. And we are employees. We are Oregonians. And we are those who recognize the unique opportunity that now stands before this incredible state. Together, we have actively supported and contributed to the growing momentum of Oregon\u2019s nascent startup community \u2014 and the sustainable increase in economic development it portends.<\/p>\n<p>We firmly believe that providing the $1.9 million to the Oregon Growth Board to continue the Oregon Growth Fund initiative is crucial to continuing this momentum. This efficient and impactful investment funds a variety of programs that help startups at their most formative and fragile stages.<\/p>\n<p>It funds incubators and accelerators. It funds Angel conferences. And it funds organizations.<\/p>\n<p>The combined efforts of these entities are critical. And their impact on the State of Oregon is significant \u2014 from our largest urban areas to our most rural regions. These efforts result in innovation. These efforts result in jobs with industry leading wages. These efforts result in engaged and supportive communities. And each dollar invested in these efforts returns exponentially more revenue to the Oregon tax base.<\/p>\n<p>At this critical juncture, the State of Oregon needs to increase \u2014 not decrease \u2014 its support for new businesses and entrepreneurs to ensure sustainable and resilient economic development. Without this funding, we stand a very real risk of losing what all of us have been working diligently to build.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You can help to promote this petition at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/oregon-state-house-oregon-state-senate-support-oregon-house-bill-2276\">https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/oregon-state-house-oregon-state-senate-support-oregon-house-bill-2276<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are entrepreneurs.
