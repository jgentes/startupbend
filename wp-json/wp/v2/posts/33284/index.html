The company combines an enthusiasm for the outdoors with tech know-how to create a software product that helps public agencies and nonprofits make more accurate, interactive maps of their parks. The end goal: To get more people outside. We get it. StartupBend caught up with Monteau and CEO Ryan Branciforte to learn more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trailheadlabs.com\/\">Trailhead Labs<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Location:<\/strong> San Francisco, Calif. and Bend, Ore.<br \/>\n<strong>Founders:<\/strong> CEO Ryan Branciforte and CTO Jereme Monteau<br \/>\n<strong>Started:<\/strong> 2012<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does Trailhead Labs do?<\/strong><br \/>\nBranciforte: We\u2019re focused on building innovative technology to get people more connected to the outdoors. Our business is built around a platform called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.outerspatial.com\/\">OuterSpatial<\/a>, which we designed to help organizations manage and publish their outdoor assets so that they and others can build better maps and apps.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33286\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33286\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ryan_branciforte.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33286\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ryan_branciforte-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Branciforte, CEO Trailhead Labs.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ryan_branciforte-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ryan_branciforte-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ryan_branciforte.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33286\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ryan Branciforte, CEO Trailhead Labs.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How are your clients using the product?<br \/>\n<\/strong>Monteau: Our clients are really demonstrating all the ways you can put our platform to use. For example, we have one nonprofit in Portland that is using the product to aggregate GIS data across dozens of jurisdictions and build more comprehensive maps and an interactive website. We also just launched the <a href=\"http:\/\/ridgetrail.outerspatial.com\">Bay Area Ridge Trail map<\/a>, which details the hundreds of miles of trails overlooking San Francisco Bay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What sparked the idea for Trailhead Labs? <\/strong><br \/>\nBranciforte: Jereme and I were friends before we were business partners. I was working for the Bay Area Open Space Council, a coalition of land management agencies and we had developed a print map that illustrated trails that you could access via public transportation. Jereme saw a version of it and wanted to make it interactive. We started to develop a prototype for that for Open Space Council and the Bay Area community.<\/p>\n<p>Monteau: We realized during that process that managing all this information about public lands is a challenge for a lot of organizations &#8212; and for consumers looking to find accurate data. There are tens of thousands of groups that work with public lands and they\u2019re using different maps and information sources. People often have to piece it together themselves. We realized that we could pull all this info into one application.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33287\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33287\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/jmoe_headshot_square.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33287\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/jmoe_headshot_square-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Jereme Monteau, CTO Trailhead Labs.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/jmoe_headshot_square-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/jmoe_headshot_square-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/jmoe_headshot_square.jpg 757w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jereme Monteau, CTO Trailhead Labs.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Beyond creating better maps, you mentioned wanting to foster a more open way of publishing public park data. Why is that important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monteau: Public agencies aren\u2019t really in the business of building web applications for consumers, but they can make that data easily available. If we can provide a pathway for the public agencies to modernize their content, then other developers will find cool ways to use it to make additional applications.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-9-e1450375592166.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33288\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-9-e1450375592166-500x246.png\" alt=\"Maps!

Lots of my previous work was focused on conservation. I see this as helping people get more connected to the land, which is how people grow to appreciate it &#8212; and that drives them to want to protect it. It\u2019s a subtle shift.<\/p>\n<p>Monteau: I feel like I was born into tech. In high school, I was a programmer &#8212; and the first employee &#8212; for Alaska\u2019s first Internet Service provider. I moved to the Bay Area in 1999 and was part of several startups, either founding them or as early employee. When Ryan and I started work on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.transitandtrails.org\">Transit and Trails project<\/a>, that when I saw opportunity to combine my passion for outdoors with tech.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does your product have any application to the private sector?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nBranciforte: We\u2019ve dabbled in that a bit and it\u2019s part of our longer term strategy. I think our product would work for any outdoor brand that has an interest in ensuring their customers have the most updated information about the places where they\u2019re using their products. We\u2019re excited to be the platform that can provide this &#8212; there are a lot of possibilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jereme, you just moved here. What brought you to Bend? <\/strong><br \/>\nMonteau: I\u2019d been in the Bay Area for 16 years. After my wife and I had kids, we started to get excited about exploring another area. We were looking at Portland over the summer, but then we made a stop here first. We wanted to get back to the mountains (Mounteau is from Alaska and his wife is from Santa Fe) and Bend felt really good to us. Within a month we\u2019d packed up and put our house on the market. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to find a vibrant startup community here, and a real connection between tech, startups and the outdoor industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lastly, what\u2019s the next year hold for Trailhead Labs? <\/strong><br \/>\nBranciforte: It\u2019s going to be a big year. We\u2019ve been heavy into customer development and product development over the past year, and now we\u2019re ready to launch a bunch of stuff. We\u2019re acquiring customers &#8212; we currently have a dozen &#8212; and we plan to grow, refine the produce and develop some new ideas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bend\u2019s startup community has a new addition in Trailhead Labs, a San Francisco-based duo, whose CTO Jereme Monteau recently relocated [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":33288,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33284"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=33284"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33284\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":33290,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33284\/revisions\/33290"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/33288"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=33284"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=33284"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=33284"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
