The Technology Association of Oregon put out a survey last month to area tech employers, asking about their hiring plans. Twenty-nine companies responded, noting that they planned to hire a cumulative 280+ people into tech-related positions, says Teri Hockett, VP of TAO and head of the Central Oregon TAO office.<\/p>\n<p>What kinds of jobs are these? Teri notes that the positions in demand include high-level CIO and CTO positions, as well as software developers, web developers, product managers, IT support, network security and more.<\/p>\n<p>This is kind of a good news\/ruh-roh situation&#8211;or as the optimist in me likes to say: good news <em>plus an opportunity<\/em>. The upside: Bend&#8217;s tech community continues to grow. Existing companies are getting bigger and new ones are popping up all the time. It&#8217;s heartening to see this community strengthen and improve, and to know that it&#8217;s only getting better.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunity? Well, Teri notes that &#8220;there are more openings than we have the pipeline for.&#8221; That works in your favor if you&#8217;re a tech person job hunting, but it&#8217;s definitely a challenge for the companies hiring. (It&#8217;s also a problem not necessarily unique to Bend).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve already seen some local workarounds to the talent gap, including hybrid remote and local teams, overseas outsourcing and of course, supplemental help from contractors.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, several Central Oregon organizations including TAO, EDCO, East Cascades Workforce Investment Board, OSU-Cascades and more are exploring ways to permanently boost the tech talent pool.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the Apprenti program recently launched in Central Oregon, providing one-year apprenticeships for people wanting to dig into technology careers, with a focus on recruiting women, minority and veteran applicants.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendbulletin.com\/newsroomstafflist\/5755941-151\/tech-apprenticeship-program-launches-in-bend\">Teri told The Bulletin, that the first 10 to 12 people in the Bend program<\/a> should start their software development training by February.\u00a0OSU-Cascades is also growing its CS program, with instructor Yong Bakos working closely with local tech employers as well.<\/p>\n<p>Last note and shameless plug: If you are job hunting, check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/startupbend.com\/jobs\">jobs board for openings<\/a>.
