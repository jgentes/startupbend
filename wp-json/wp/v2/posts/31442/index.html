For free. First up: Brian Vierra, EDCO\u2019s Venture Catalyst, with five ways to improve your business pitch. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Vierra has both pitched &#8212; and sold &#8212; a business to investors. He exited a corporate training company he founded in 2007. He also happens to be on the investor committee for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonangelfund.com\/\">Oregon Angel Fund<\/a>. In that capacity, he reviews dozens of pitches a month to determine whether they are worthy of investment.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, as the organizer of the upcoming Bend Venture Conference, he\u2019s currently helping review pitches from both the launch and concept stage companies. It\u2019s basically all pitches, all the time. So here is Vierra\u2019s free advice for making your pitch stand out.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31443\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31443\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brian-Vierra.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31443\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brian-Vierra-500x332.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Vierra, EDCO Venture Catalyst\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brian-Vierra-500x332.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brian-Vierra-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Brian-Vierra-800x531.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31443\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brian Vierra, EDCO Venture Catalyst<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>1. Clearly state the problem your business is going to solve. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before you even go into what your company does, Vierra wants to know what problem you&#8217;re addressing and why your business is coming into existence right now. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a couple of companies where it doesn&#8217;t look like there\u2019s a problem to solve,\u201d Vierra says. \u201cYou have to hit people at their pain points. That\u2019s one of the success factors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Use more pictures in your presentation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery once in a while I\u2019ll see a slide that is 10 different bullet point,\u201d Vierra says. \u201cNo one is going to read all that.\u201d Vierra likes to see pictures, graphs and charts that illustrate the problem your business is trying to solve and your solution. \u201cInvestors want it to be easy to move forward,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a struggle and they need to make a huge effort to understand what you do, you decrease the odds of them becoming involved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Assume in your revenue projections that you\u2019ve already received funding. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong>I\u2019ve seen two kind of projections, one that shows what happens if they get the funding. And another where the founders assume they won\u2019t get any funding and then project what their numbers are going to look like,\u201d Vierra says. The latter fizzles because it reveals no ambition. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking for $500,000 or $1 million, I want to know what you\u2019re going to do with it and what that will look like,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Focus, focus, focus. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs have big ideas. Usually lots of them. But they often forget that this is the first time an investor is being exposed to their first and best idea, and the speed right past it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t immediately jump into your other streams of revenue and other partnerships and how you can do this thing or that,\u201d Vierra says. \u201cSlow down. Go back to what is the first business idea and how big can that get.\u201d Once you set the hook, you want to reel those fish in, instead of trying to bait them with even more hooks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. D.U.A (Don\u2019t Use Acronyms) <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Investors consider lots of pitches from a wide variety of industries. It\u2019s challenging to stay current on the all the\u00a0acronyms and jargon in your business. Instead of boggling their mind with an alphabet soup, make it easy for investors (and, ahem, bloggers) to understand what you do. \u201cAs an investor, when you start hearing about things you\u2019re unfamiliar with, you begin to question whether you know enough to jump in and be of help,\u201d Vierra says.<\/p>\n<p>See, that wasn\u2019t too painful. And hopefully it was even helpful.
