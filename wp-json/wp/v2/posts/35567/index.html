David connects the dots for why this is an issue for the tech community and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>By David Welton<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bend has a promising startup landscape, but like many other things in town, it\u2019s \u201cunder construction.\u201d One advantage we have is that we can learn from the mistakes that other towns have made. One problem that many other places with successful tech industries face is that housing supply has not kept pace with the number of people who want to live there. This drives up prices, with some ugly consequences for the people forced out, as well as the broader community. For an area that has yet to fully cement its position as a local tech hub, there are also some direct costs to businesses:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowledge businesses, which include most startups, depend on their employees: without the right employees, even the best of ideas will go nowhere. And good employees, like everyone else, are interested in being well-compensated for what they do. Bend\u2019s a great place to live, but being able to live in a place with so many opportunities for outdoor recreation only goes so far, and spending power still counts for a lot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people spend something like \u2153 of their income on housing &#8211; it\u2019s their single largest expense. Since 2012, the price of housing in Bend has nearly <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doubled<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This means that if you run a business, or are investing in a company, your would have to spend twice what you would have for the people in your company &#8211; or local portfolio companies if you\u2019re an investor &#8211; to occupy the same housing. In other words, your ability to attract and retain talented new workers in Bend, has taken a big hit, because of rapidly appreciating house prices. To be fair, 2012 was at the bottom of the trough, so we can debate the exact numbers, but the point stands: keeping house prices under control would make it easier to hire new employees who do not already own a house in Bend, or if you\u2019re self funded, give you a longer runway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The direct effects on local companies are obvious, but there are knock-on effects of the housing crisis as well. Do you have kids in school, or plan to one day, and want them to have good teachers? Ever needed a nurse, firefighters or the police? These are all hard working people our community needs, who may one day be priced out if Bend\u2019s housing prices continue to climb. This is not hypothetical &#8211; look at the California Bay Area as an example of how badly things can go wrong. Not to mention all the people who work in service industries that pay even less.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any other good, housing is governed by the laws of supply and demand: building enough housing causes prices to drop. And as this article explains, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sightline.org\/2017\/09\/21\/yes-you-can-build-your-way-to-affordable-housing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there are a wide variety of ways to add housing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ranging from pure sprawl to tall towers, and everything in between. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bend is growing out, some, thanks to the UGB process, but also needs to better utilize the existing space by building in and up &#8211; which also adds needed variety in our housing. The first step is to remove legal barriers to that development. Currently, zoning laws forbid most of Bend from being developed for anything but expensive single family homes, and as <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/marketurbanism.com\/2018\/02\/05\/density-working-poor-outbid-rich-urban-land\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> states, \u201cdensity is how the working poor outbid the rich for urban land.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you help?<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for the Bend YIMBY group on Facebook: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/BendYIMBY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/BendYIMBY<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or if you\u2019re busy, sign up for the low volume announcement mailing list: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bendyimby.com\/join-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/bendyimby.com\/join-us\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; fixing this problem is an ongoing, collaborative effort.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email your city councilors at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:council@bendoregon.gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">council@bendoregon.gov<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; one of the advantages of being in a town that\u2019s not too big is that they do read and even respond to their email. \u00a0Ask them to enact rule changes that favor more housing, and a larger variety of housing in Bend. A current example is aligning the \u201ccomp plan\u201d with the zoning map. Another idea would be allowing up to 4-plexes \u201cby right\u201d in all areas of the city zoned for housing. Favoring the construction of proposed apartments in all of the city &#8211; not just on the east side &#8211; would also bring a lot of supply on line.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019d like to learn more about the housing crisis and housing policy, we have a reading list here: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bendyimby.com\/2017\/06\/12\/yimby-reading\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/bendyimby.com\/2017\/06\/12\/yimby-reading\/<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a guest post from a member of our tech community, David Welton, who is spearheading the local YIMBY [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":468,"featured_media":35568,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35567"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/468"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=35567"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35567\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":35569,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35567\/revisions\/35569"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/35568"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=35567"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=35567"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=35567"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
