Meet UpTyck"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Many people would rather poke themselves in the eye than try to sell something &#8212; or many things for that matter &#8212; to a stranger. If you fall into that category and happen to be a small business owner, then Rich Fox has created UpTyck just for you. Fox has spent most of his career working in tech sales with companies such as ExtraHop Networks in Seattle.<\/p>\n<p>He knows the drill: how to manage a long list of leads, when to re-connect with a prospect after that first call and how to convert prospects to clients. But for many small businesses and startup founders, the ins and outs of sales is foreign territory. UpTyck wants to make the sales process easy by \u00a0incorporating it into your gmail account. The app provides prompts for sales tasks and integrates all your customer contact information, with the aim of transforming the accidental sales manager into a sales superstar.<\/p>\n<p>Startup: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.uptyck.com\/\">UpTyck<\/a><br \/>\nFounded: December 2014<br \/>\nFounder: Rich Fox<br \/>\nEmployees: Fox for now, and contractors<br \/>\nLocation: Bend<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do small businesses need UpTyck?<\/strong> A lot of the small businesses I\u2019ve encountered start with a single sales person, often the founder, who is trying to get the company off the ground. They don\u2019t need an extensive CRM system to track their customers and sales process. In fact, they\u2019d probably use less than 1% of it. So most of them attempt to organize their customer and prospect information on a spreadsheet. Beyond the sheer organization, they often don\u2019t know how the sales process works.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does UpTyck help?<\/strong> After working in sales for so long, you realize that the difference between successful sales people &#8212; and the unsuccessful ones &#8212; is that they are following a formula.\u00a0It includes things like following up with potential customers in a timely manner and the way you\u2019re communicating with prospects. So in addition to helping track all your customer info, UpTyck provides suggestions for the tasks you should do next such as re-connect with a past client. I call it a \u201csales manager in a box.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>And it\u2019s a Google App? <\/strong>Yes. It\u2019s actually a gmail wrapper that integrates with your email account. So when you open your gmail you see a list of leads, prospects, opportunities and customer follow-ups as well as contact info, a task list and mini calendar.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32195\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32195\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-24-at-9.38.38-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32195\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-24-at-9.38.38-PM-500x193.png\" alt=\"UpTyck integrates with your gmail account. \" width=\"500\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-24-at-9.38.38-PM-500x193.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-24-at-9.38.38-PM-1024x396.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-24-at-9.38.38-PM.png 1243w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32195\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">UpTyck integrates with your gmail account.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>So can a business grow out of UpTyck?<\/strong> We are a stop-gap tool for now. Once companies get big enough they\u2019ll likely invest in a CRM. But down the road, I want to offer a next level product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This is a fairly crowded space. How is UpTyck different?<\/strong> There\u2019s a lot of customer management products out there, but they\u2019re all reactive &#8212; they don\u2019t help users sell.\u00a0We have tasks built into the system, along with a recommendation engine, to help our users progress through the sales cycle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you funded?<\/strong> I\u2019ve bootstrapped the product\u2019s development. We just launched the first version with three or four beta users. We want to get a few more customers, and then we\u2019ll start the fundraising conversation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve worked in Portland and Seattle. What challenges do expect with starting a company here?<\/strong> There\u2019s a lot of support here, and people have been great about meeting with me and offering their advice and help. I think the main concern for any tech startup is finding tech talent. We need more technical resources.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32196\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32196\" style=\"width: 469px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150316_144204-e1427305828168.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32196\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150316_144204-e1427305828168-469x500.jpg\" alt=\"Rich Fox, founder of UpTyck. \" width=\"469\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150316_144204-e1427305828168-469x500.jpg 469w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150316_144204-e1427305828168-961x1024.jpg 961w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150316_144204-e1427305828168-800x852.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32196\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rich Fox, founder of UpTyck.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Lastly, you\u2019re a seasoned sales professional. What\u2019s the top sales mistake you see startups making?<\/strong>\u00a0The main mistake I see is small companies make is not understanding the sales process and not having the proper metrics in place to help ensure success. For example, do they require seeing a demo of the product? How many days does it take for your prospects to become customers? Having these metrics in place early as you build up your business will allow you to make smarter decisions when it comes to the product.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people would rather poke themselves in the eye than try to sell something &#8212; or many things for that [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":32196,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32194"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32194"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32194\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32197,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32194\/revisions\/32197"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/32196"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32194"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32194"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32194"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
