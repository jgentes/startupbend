Keeping Our Startup Community Generous Even as it Grows"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>One of the best things \u2013 perhaps maybe <em>the<\/em> best thing \u2013 about Bend\u2019s startup culture is how willing people are to donate their time, advice, contacts, resources and more. When my husband and I first moved here, we noticed this right away\u2014you would email someone to ask a question, and they\u2019d happily meet for coffee, give you their time, and connect you with another helpful person.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the success of startups, this kind of generosity is just as important as other critical components of the ecosystem. In fact, people new to town or to entrepreneurship here often remark on this helpfulness and collaborative spirit.<\/p>\n<p>But I\u2019ve noticed recently a slight overwhelm among many of the people who get asked for things most often. The emails and requests are pouring in. People want to help, but as the community grows so rapidly, they can\u2019t always take every coffee date and respond to every question\u2014while still growing their own business, running their fund or working their day job.<\/p>\n<p>So I asked several of these sought-after folks: How do we maintain our generous spirit without burning out? Their answers, on the record and off, provided some awesome guidance for both people on the receiving end of requests as well as those making them. Here are some of the key takeaways from those conversations.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l46Cq6Bro9CsP149q\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>You know Sponge Bob gets a lot of meeting requests. <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/stefanie-shank-house-of-joy-stef-l46Cq6Bro9CsP149q\"><br \/>\nvia GIPHY<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Respect the double intro <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I usually prefer is if someone who wants to make an introduction reaches out to me first to see if I have the time and\/or interest to be introduced to a particular person. I really appreciate this! Then, it doesn\u2019t become awkward if I say no. Especially if that person is looking for a job,\u201d says Rita Hansen, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/onboarddynamics.com\/\">Onboard Dynamics<\/a>. She notes that there are cases where a good friend or colleague who she knows well makes an introduction and in those cases she always follows up.<\/p>\n<p>By and large, most of the investors, founders, CEOs and others in our ecosystem noted that they like to be asked before being introduced to someone. I\u2019ve found most often people say yes, but asking before certainly shows that you respect people\u2019s time and gives them the choice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be cognizant of people\u2019s time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Speaking of time, that\u2019s at the crux right? People who give generously of their time so often are what makes this community tick. It&#8217;s part of why, to borrow a phrase from Dino Vendetti with <a href=\"http:\/\/sevenpeaksventures.com\/\">Seven Peaks<\/a>, Bend is able to fight above its weight when it comes to launching companies.\u00a0Julie Harrelson, co-fund manager of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cascadeangels.com\">Cascade Angels<\/a>, uses a few time management hacks to address the increased influx of requests sent her way. If a coffee or longer meeting doesn\u2019t work, she deploys the 5-10 minute rule and spends a few minutes to connect people, events and resources to build a stronger community.<\/p>\n<p>Time is a finite resource, and it\u2019s something to consider. If you\u2019re asking for someone\u2019s time, especially on a first meeting, try to keep it to 30 minutes. Robert Pease \u2013 Julie\u2019s colleague and co-fund manager at Cascade Angels \u2013 says sometimes a phone call is what he can fit in most quickly. \u201cPhone\/video is easier than in-person for busy people,\u201d he says. \u201cAn in-person costs 15-30 minutes on each end to get there so an hour takes two to deliver. Even in Bend it takes the before\/after time to get to a meeting (and then back to the office), and it\u2019s more in major metros.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask, but also offer <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To a one, the people I talked to about this noted that they deeply appreciated when a person who asked for their help, also offered them something. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as buying someone a coffee and saying thanks. Other times, they might just put it out there \u2014 \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything I can do for you.\u201d Julie noted that she\u2019s sometimes sent someone a helpful article or resource they might find interesting along with a note of thanks.<\/p>\n<p>Digging in here for a minute: It\u2019s easy to assume when you\u2019re in the asking position that you don\u2019t have anything to offer. That\u2019s a mistake. Regardless of who you\u2019re meeting, you can likely provide them with something helpful, even if it\u2019s later down the road. You might have a contact that your coffee date hopes to meet, you might someday refer them a job candidate or be able to answer a question about your industry. You never know, and offering truly keeps all this good mojo going. It\u2019s like refueling the generosity tank.<\/p>\n<p>On the face, this post feels a bit like a Miss Manners column (also don\u2019t put your elbows on the table or wear white after Labor Day). But truly, it\u2019s more than that. Our community is growing exponentially, and so many of us are new to the area and eager to meet people and dig in. It\u2019s exciting and inspiring and from my perspective, our community excels at welcoming anyone who wants to participate with open arms.<\/p>\n<p>But we don\u2019t want <em>those arms to get tired<\/em>. So paying attention to this aspect of our community\u2014its generous spirit and big heart\u2014and caring for it like we would any other valuable resource is vitally important. We want people to ask for help and we want to keep giving it. That\u2019s the Bend way.<\/p>\n<p>Have other thoughts about how to keep our community generous?
