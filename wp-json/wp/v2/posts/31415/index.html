We have created a personal, emergency notification service that provides a simple way to inform your loved ones about where you\u2019re going and when you\u2019ll be back.It then institutes a series of escalating responses if you don&#8217;t return. Those range from contacting your personal safety team (your mom, friend, spouse) to, if necessary, engaging a professional rescue coordination team. Other apps send a message when you arrive. But we think we add significant value by sending a message when you don\u2019t, and then initiating a plan to professionally address your safety.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Complete this sentence: We are like the _____ of\/for ______ \u00a0(Uber for house plants; Twitter for cats)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re like the \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d for your loved ones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspired your company? <\/strong>It was started by my co-founder, Steve Minar. He wanted a simple solution to replace the note on the dashboard of a car or stuck to the refrigerator telling someone of the activity you were off doing. It\u2019s a unique solution for a fundamental problem that applies to anyone planning an activity. For me as a first responder with the National Ski Patrol, I was inspired to see how it could become a new standard of care for not only personal safety, but also as a resource for search and rescue, and the emergency management community. Ubimodo is positioning its brand as an essential tool to manage your personal safety and protect those you care about, while serving the safety of the rescuer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So how\u2019s business? <\/strong>We recently finished our fourth prototype and we\u2019re now in app development, and moving toward the next level of user testing. Robert Koester, the leading expert in the field of search and rescue, has joined our team. And we\u2019ve acquired our first two API partners to help us take our product to market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you raised any money? <\/strong>We\u2019ve raised $50,000 in seed funding, and we\u2019re finalizing some additional investment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How will you make money?\u00a0<\/strong>We plan earn revenue from our user subscriptions and from partnerships with other applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What have you learned? <\/strong>It\u2019s a huge amount of work to focus your presentation to effectively tell your story. You have to always keep in mind who is your audience. I\u2019ve also learned not to be shy about engaging others to help us tell our story better. We hired the Cascadian Group here in Bend to do just that. It\u2019s great to drink your own Kool Aid, but after a while it gets stale. Cascadian gave us quite an insightful grilling during an early pitch session. So I knew they were the right people to bring on board to mix a fresh batch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next? <\/strong>Taking our app prototype to the next level of development and continuing our UI\/UX testing. We did the first stage of development in San Francisco with an excellent firm. Now we\u2019re bringing the development back to Central Oregon. Our first API partners are here as well, so we\u2019re able to keep our things close to home, and easy to manage. It\u2019s also cost effective.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Random facts to blow people\u2019s minds: <\/strong>Well\u00a0I spent 12 years in the film business, 10 of which was working with Director James Cameron on Terminator 2, T2-3D, True Lies and the Titanic. After working with Cameron for 10 years, there\u2019s nothing that anybody can throw at me that\u2019s more challenging.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31416\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31416\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140909_144039.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31416\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140909_144039-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"A movie set memento.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140909_144039-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140909_144039-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31416\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A movie set memento.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Next week in #50startups:<\/strong> Bend-based <a href=\"http:\/\/stridebox.com\/\">StrideBox<\/a> sends runners a monthly subscription box filled with goodies.
