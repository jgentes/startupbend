BendTECH is hiring a community and operations manager.<\/p>\n<div>In this position, you&#8217;ll handle the daily operations of our coworking space. That means onboarding new members, responding to member inquiries, organizing monthly get togethers, managing our member and office wait list, keeping tabs on our monthly budget and marketing our events.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The work may include ordering the monthly keg and facilitating Taco Tuesdays, implementing new educational programs, developing community partners, tracking member payments and organizing happy hours. In your downtime, you can experiment with fun new ways to serve our vibrant member community of startups, entrepreneurs and remote workers. We know it&#8217;s a range of tasks, and the right person will like trying new things, while staying on top of what needs to be done.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s a fun, friendly and much sought after space.

Email a cover letter and resume to coworking@bendtech.com<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div>Now I&#8217;m 1000% biased because I&#8217;m on the BendTECH board. But the space is a really special place. It&#8217;s filled with interested, fired-up people. I&#8217;ve watched businesses start, startups move into offices and then out and into bigger offices. There are remote workers for big, innovative tech companies. There is at least one blogger. And there&#8217;s a regular spate of events that happen monthly including happy hours, Taco Tuesdays, lunch and learns and more. It&#8217;s growing up (sniff sniff).
