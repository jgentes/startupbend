The pair <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/wildish\/mc-hammie-worlds-most-versatile-hammock\">debuted the M.C. Hammie on Kickstarter last week<\/a>, and they&#8217;ve raised more than $8,200 of their $15,000 goal already.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XhiZF9cPxEU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The founders plans to use the money to manufacture the M.C. Hammie. But first, what is it exaclty? It&#8217;s a three-in-one hammock, shelter and blanket. Up to eight of your very best friends can lounge on this thing when it&#8217;s spread out on the ground. Then, it pops into a little shelter and you can hop inside, or string it between two trees and ta dah &#8212; a hammock.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34647\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34647\" style=\"width: 370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34647 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/mc-hammie-370x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/mc-hammie-370x1024.png 370w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/mc-hammie-181x500.png 181w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/mc-hammie.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34647\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Must love Rainier beer.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Rick and Adam started their company last year with another gear reinvention that they call Mr. Big Stuff (props for creative product names). That is basically a gigantic beach blanket that packs down into a teeny tiny pouch for travel. The duo sold 500 of the blankets in their first month.<\/p>\n<p>With backgrounds in engineering (Rick) and design (Adam), the co-founders see the M.C. Hammie and Mr. Big Stuff as the beginning of a outdoor gear products company that is &#8220;bringing the fun back to outdoor gear,&#8221; according to their news release.<\/p>\n<p>If the Kickstarter is any indication, <a href=\"https:\/\/staywildish.com\/\">Wildish<\/a> is well on its way. The rewards include a (likely virtual) high five from Rick for those who donate $5, and a real-life M.C. Hammie for those who kick in $84 to $99, depending on when you contribute. If you&#8217;re feeling exceptionally inspired, anyone who donates $3,000 will win a Bend Dream Getaway, hosted by co-founder Adam and Rick themselves. Tempted?<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/wildish\/mc-hammie-worlds-most-versatile-hammock\">Kickstarter campaign runs through the end of the month<\/a>.
