On the to-do list: Creating a UX design academy, cultivating more mid-sized tech companies, and finding ways to attract more software developers and grow our own.<\/p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendbulletin.com\/home\/2315291-151\/growing-the-tech-scene-in-bend\">the story<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">Bend has been dubbed an entrepreneurial hot spot, as well as a growing tech cluster. It\u2019s received national attention for its ecosystem that includes a startup accelerator called FoundersPad and the largest angel conference in the Pacific Northwest, the Bend Venture Conference. Yet (Meg) McDonald, a user-experience designer, had never heard of Bend until several months ago.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">\u201cIt had never crossed my radar,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore Bend, I was thinking I would relocate to Las Vegas, maybe New Mexico or Colorado.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">Dino Vendetti, co-founder of FoundersPad and general partner of Seven Peaks Ventures, and Bruce Cleveland, general partner at Silicon Valley-based InterWest Partners, think a design academy for user experience \u2014 the way a customer interacts with a product \u2014 could put Bend on the map. They believe it could cultivate talent locally, make Bend a destination for technology professionals and help existing tech companies grow.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">Other technology experts think having a more diverse employment landscape, one with midtier companies that have one to 10 high-tech jobs as a supporting element, could give tech professionals more employment options and reduce the risk factor of moving to a small town. However, most agree the tight local rental market is a major obstacle for importing talent and new tech businesses.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">So just how hard is it to find a rental? I&#8217;ve seen numerous sources report vacancy rates at less than 1% this year. Realtors say two things are driving those rates down: Rising home prices have more people putting their rental homes up for sale, and more people are moving here.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.buybendoregonhomes.com\/tight-rental-market-bend-oregon-leads-rising-rents-vacancies\/\">This blogger reports<\/a> that for many renters finding a rental becomes a full-time job (the fun kind where you don&#8217;t get a paycheck), that many people rent homes without seeing them in person and that there&#8217;s now a Facebook support group called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/492828947528393\/\">Bend Housing and Rental Relief<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">The story raises some interesting ideas for giving the tech cluster here more momentum. But the rental issue is a conundrum.\u00a0Should we create a commune of tricked-out Airstreams just for software developers? (You could call it the Nerd Herd. Someone get on this).<\/p>\n<p class=\"Newstext\" style=\"color: #333333;\">But seriously: Has the lack of rentals prevented any new hires? Are employers here doing anything to help potential hires find housing?
