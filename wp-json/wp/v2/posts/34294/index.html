There are shelves filled with dozens of brands of shoes, many of which George has ripped apart, modified and re-engineered all in with the aim of getting rid of the shoelaces.<\/p>\n<p>Why? \u201cI was losing time during duathlon transitions getting my shoes on and off. I wanted a better way,\u201d George says. His better way \u2013 a Bend startup called <a href=\"http:\/\/piercefootwear.com\/\">Pierce Footwear<\/a> \u2013 provides professional athletes, several local runners and the entire U.S. Special Olympics Winter Team with an innovative lace-less shoe.<\/p>\n<p>Now George is starting to raise a Series A to ramp production of his shoes and make them even more widely available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From couch to Worlds<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>George\u2019s background is mix of tech, entrepreneurship and professional athletics. Before starting Pierce Footwear in 2013, he spent a decade working in Silicon Valley. He founded a tech company, which gave employers a way to track their employees\u2019 wellness, that was acquired in 2008.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34295\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34295\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34295\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0718-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0718-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0718.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34295\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">George Pierce holding the prototype for his first laceless shoe.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He was a professional, world champion duathlete from 1989 to 1999 and then raced again for the U.S. Team from 2011 to 2015. He\u2019d retired in the interim when tragedy struck \u2013 George was hit by a car while riding his bike in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was almost killed. I broke my neck and back,\u201d he says. George threw himself into his recovery, with the goal of making a comeback to not just duathlon races, but racing at the elite level again. He made the U.S. Team in 2011 and raced at the world duathlon championship that same year. \u201cI went from the couch to the world championship in 16 months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>An idea with legs \u2013 and feet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That brings us back up to where we started: George was racing again and wanted faster transition times. It was a problem that, of course, he figured he could solve himself by inventing better shoes. \u201cI took my shoes and my idea to a cobbler and said can we do this?\u201d George recalls. \u201cWe built the first prototype in two weeks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>George started racing on his invention, and realized that indeed his transitions were getting faster. Convinced he had an idea with legs, he booked a ticket to Korea, which is the hub of all shoe manufacturing. He made 400 prototypes in his first year, selling them at cost to anyone who could offer feedback \u2013 professional athletes, neighbors, his kids.<\/p>\n<p>People loved them. And George quickly realized that the fact that his shoes were so quick and easy to slip on made them great products not just for elite athletes, but for people with limited mobility, hard-to-fit feet and other shoe struggles. And another market was born.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34300\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34300\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34300\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pierce-T1-500x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pierce-T1-500x400.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pierce-T1-768x614.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Pierce-T1-1024x819.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34300\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meet the Pierce Footwear T-1.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Investing in a mission<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Pierce Footwear T-1s officially hit the market in March 2016.
