But if that is all young women hear about, what would motivate a girl to go into a field where she would be considered an outsider?<\/p>\n<p>I feel extremely lucky to have had an amazing career in the technology industry, most recently as the principal director of research for Microsoft. I have never felt like an outsider, but this is not what our young girls hear today. I love living in Central Oregon where we have a blossoming tech startup eco-system building and passionate fellow board members on the Tech Alliance of Central Oregon working hard to support companies in technology, but when I speak to young women they have never heard about these great opportunities. In Oregon we have approximately 250 high schools, but only 30 of them teach some type of computer science class. In Central Oregon we only have three.<\/p>\n<p>So the hope of myself and a number of organizations is we can change the message. We want to show young women the impact they can make with a computer science degree and career. The solution for many of the century\u2019s most pressing problems \u00a0\u2013 climate change, universal access to water, accessible renewable energy sources, cures for HIV or cancer, the digital divide \u2013 will require the skills of engineers and computer scientists.<\/p>\n<p>We want more young women around the world and especially in Central Oregon to become producers of technology&#8211;not just consumers. We need parents, teachers and counselors to encourage young girls into these fields. That\u2019s why I helped start the \u00a0Big Dream Movement.\u00a0Launched in March 2014 at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/msr_er\/archive\/2014\/03\/24\/inviting-girls-to-dream-big.aspx\">Big Dream Movement<\/a>\u00a0connects girls all over the globe with organizations, academia, and resources to help them pursue a future in STEM fields.<\/p>\n<p>The movement is anchored by the\u00a0<em><a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/apps\/video\/default.aspx?id=210728\">Big Dream<\/a><\/em>, a documentary film (underwritten by Microsoft) that follows the stories of seven young women who are breaking barriers and overcoming personal challenges to follow their passions in STEM fields. From small town Iowa to the bustling streets of the Middle East,\u00a0the <em>Big Dream<\/em>\u00a0immerses viewers in a world designed by and for the next generation of girls.<\/p>\n<p>We debuted the film earlier this month at the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/napavalleyfilmfest.org\/films\/big-dream\">Napa Valley Film Festival<\/a>. I joined Iron Way Films Director Kelly Cox\u00a0to introduce the project. Cox\u2019s hope is that this inspirational film will excite young women, their families, and friends to the possibilities inherent in science and technology.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31768\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31768\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FB_20141119_18_33_28_Saved_Picture.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31768\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FB_20141119_18_33_28_Saved_Picture-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"A student at the premier of the Big Dream film last month. \" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FB_20141119_18_33_28_Saved_Picture-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FB_20141119_18_33_28_Saved_Picture-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FB_20141119_18_33_28_Saved_Picture.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31768\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A student at the premier of the Big Dream film last month.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Next the film heads to Washington D.C. for Computer Science Education Week, where they will do a briefing with congressional members, have screenings at Microsoft and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and do an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/about\/corporatecitizenship\/en-us\/youthspark\/youthsparkhub\/hourofcode\/\">Hour Of Code<\/a>\u00a0programming with students in D.C. public schools.<\/p>\n<p>Then in January, the Big Dream will come to Bend through the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendbulletin.com\/localstate\/1826614-151\/stem-money-to-central-oregon\">Central Oregon STEM Hub<\/a>. In addition, any organization, government entity, or business will be able to do free screenings of the film after Computer Science Education Week. You can register to do that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bigdreammovement.com\/host-big-dream-screening\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and after December you will get information on how to access the film for a showing. You\u2019ll also receive a toolkit that provides information about free resources to encourage young girls to learn computer science.<\/p>\n<p>In Bend and around the world, we want young women to know that not only is there a demand for these jobs, but that they can make a difference by choosing a computer science or engineering path. We can tell all of our children that computer science is creative, collaborative and impactful field of study.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/people\/ranej\/default.aspx\">Rane<\/a>\u00a0is a local Bend resident and on the board of the Tech Alliance of Central Oregon, she is also Principal Research Director for Microsoft Research, where she focuses on how diversity of thought drives innovation.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Rane Johnson Tech Alliance of Central Oregon Board Member Principal Research Director, Microsoft Research Being in the technology industry [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":31769,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[17,47],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/31766"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=31766"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/31766\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":31771,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/31766\/revisions\/31771"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/31769"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=31766"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=31766"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=31766"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
