This: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adventurecodeschool.com\/\">Adventure Code School<\/a>. Bend web developer Chris Tsongas has created a code school that combines learning to code with all sorts of outdoor adventure and exercise, including rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking and daily yoga.<\/p>\n<p>The school&#8217;s first bootcamp begins in Bend this Sept. and runs 12 weeks. From the school&#8217;s website:<\/p>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1412381143917_19852\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<blockquote><p>Start an awesome new career supported by yoga, meditation and amazing outdoor activities.\u00a0Adventure Code School&#8217;s 12-week Full-Stack JavaScript Bootcamp teaches the most in-demand programming skills, plus Yoga for Coders\u2122,\u00a0meditation enhanced with binaural beat soundtracks, and expert instruction in mountain biking, slacklining, rock climbing and whitewater kayaking!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The idea is to support what the students are learning and enhance their intellectual development with physical activity &#8212; and take advantage of all the fun Bend has to offer. &#8220;These activities give your mind time to process what you learn in the classroom, so you can ramp up your coding skills by building on previous material,&#8221; according to the ACS website.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-34019\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2016-08-12-12.23.29-500x274.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-08-12 12.23.29\" width=\"500\" height=\"274\" data-wp-pid=\"34019\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2016-08-12-12.23.29-500x274.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2016-08-12-12.23.29-768x420.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2016-08-12-12.23.29-1024x560.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2016-08-12-12.23.29-800x438.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Chris is no stranger to teaching. In addition to working as a web developer for 17 years, including at G5, he&#8217;s also taught for many code schools including Code Fellows. He&#8217;s a certified yoga instructor, and he&#8217;s trained in the fine arts. So the guy knows some stuff.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adventurecodeschool.com\/#events\">hosting four events<\/a> &#8212; in Seattle, Portland, Eugene and Bend &#8212; so that people can meet Chris in person and learn more about Adventure Code School. There&#8217;s also a virtual preview scheduled for Saturday (8\/13). You do need to RSVP.<\/p>\n<p>The Bend bootcamp is aiming to enroll up to 16 students. So if you&#8217;re looking to take a deep dive into coding &#8212; and have some Central Oregon adventure &#8212; you found it.
