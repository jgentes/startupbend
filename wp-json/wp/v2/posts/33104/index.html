KrowdFit, a Bend-based fitness tech startup, has created a wellness reward program that offers cash prizes &#8212; with winners drawn at random &#8212; to participants.<\/p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"http:\/\/pressrelease.pw\/krowdfit-partners-with-metro-to-financially-incentivize-employee\/\">recently announced that it had partnered with Oregon Metro<\/a> to offer its corporate wellness program to government personnel. Beginning this month, Metro&#8217;s 1,600-plus employees\u00a0will be eligible for KrowdFit&#8217;s weekly, monthly and quarterly cash rewards of up to $5,000.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/thejimmiller\">CEO Jim Miller<\/a> says the fun &#8212; and prizes &#8212; aren&#8217;t reserved for corporate employees. Individuals can participate too. The startup&#8217;s release of its <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/krowdfit\/id1040592197?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">iOS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.krowdfit.mobile\">Droid apps<\/a> earlier this month make it that much easier.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33105\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33105\" style=\"width: 320px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Jim-Miller-BW-Site.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-33105\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Jim-Miller-BW-Site.jpg\" alt=\"Krowdfit CEO Jim Miller.

For instance, you can receive one entry for every meal you log into weekly drawing for $125. There are 12 winners each week.<\/p>\n<p>In another challenge, you can earn one entry for every hour of exercise you log into a\u00a0quarterly drawing for $5,000. You can also win cash for sleeping (sign me up!) and tracking your steps.\u00a0You don&#8217;t have to be the best at a challenge or lose the most weight. You just have to participate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can come in, drop out, come back in,&#8221; Miller says. &#8220;It&#8217;s entirely up to you how you play the game.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The money for the prizes comes from a portion of people&#8217;s KrowdFit memberships. Companies that use the platform may also run their own internal challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Miller and the company&#8217;s CTO, Shawn Beach, relocated to Bend from Seattle. Though the rest of company&#8217;s executives and team are in Portland and the Puget Sound area, Miller says the plan is to grow the startup&#8217;s presence here. &#8220;We wanted to be in Bend because so many people are already living the healthy lifestyle that KrowdFit promotes,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you want the chance to win money for exercising, eating healthy or even sleeping?
