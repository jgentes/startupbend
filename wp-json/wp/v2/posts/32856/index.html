And probably a bar or two. However, since the new 1001 tech center opened last spring, Stackhouse Coffee has quickly become one of the go-to fuel stops for Bend techies, startup founders, investors and more.<\/p>\n<p>We recently sat down with the people behind the startup &#8212; Jake and Rebecca Hermeling &#8212; to learn a little more about the vision behind Stackhouse and what\u2019s next for the young entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you get your start in coffee?<\/strong> (Jake)\u00a0I\u2019ve been in the industry 9 years. I started at Starbucks, like a lot of people in my generation. Then I moved to Southwest Washington, where I helped some family friends open two coffee shops.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Was your goal to open a shop in Bend?<\/strong> Yes, I grew up here. My family has always been entrepreneurs, in fact my dad owned one of the old mills known by locals as \u201cThe Boxhouse.&#8221; After Washington, I moved back here and got my real estate license. I had an office in the previous TechSpace, which is how I learned about the 1001 building and opportunity there.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32857\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32857\" style=\"width: 507px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/A-beautiful-day-the-neighborhood.-misterrogers-brewgood-the1001bend-photooftheday-summer-morning-by-stackhousecoffee.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-32857\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/A-beautiful-day-the-neighborhood.-misterrogers-brewgood-the1001bend-photooftheday-summer-morning-by-stackhousecoffee-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"Stackhouse\" width=\"507\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/A-beautiful-day-the-neighborhood.-misterrogers-brewgood-the1001bend-photooftheday-summer-morning-by-stackhousecoffee-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/A-beautiful-day-the-neighborhood.-misterrogers-brewgood-the1001bend-photooftheday-summer-morning-by-stackhousecoffee-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/A-beautiful-day-the-neighborhood.-misterrogers-brewgood-the1001bend-photooftheday-summer-morning-by-stackhousecoffee.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stackhouse coffee at the 1001 Tech Center.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Were you concerned about whether the location could support a shop?<\/strong> \u00a0We knew that we needed to create something special enough to win both inside and outside the business park, but honestly we didn\u2019t expect to be this busy so soon. I thought it would just be Rebecca and I for at least six months, but we ended up hiring staff by the second week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was your vision for Stackhouse?<\/strong> There\u2019s definitely a wide variety &#8212; you have coffee snobs and people who just want a tasty morning jolt. Coffee is an exciting journey for me and I appreciate that it\u2019s complex and nuanced. But as a cafe, our business depends on hospitality and service just as much as the quality of the products. We like coffee and we like people. So for us I think the biggest thing was creating an environment where you can feel comfortable wherever you are at on your coffee journey. One of the things unique about our shop is that our <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/29RAuEtmh9\/?taken-by=stackhousecoffee\" target=\"_blank\">equipment<\/a>\u00a0and bar layout allows us to make your drink right in front of you. Most people don\u2019t know what goes in to their coffee so it\u2019s fun to see people learn about the process without even realizing it. It\u2019s a great way for us to keep guests engaged while they\u2019re waiting.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32858\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32858\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Weve-partnered-up-with-@wanderlusttours-to-show-people-how-coffee-is-done-inbend-The-siphon-sure-gets-a-lot-of-oohs-and-ahhhs.-brewgood-the1001bend-by-stackhousecoffee.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-32858 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Weve-partnered-up-with-@wanderlusttours-to-show-people-how-coffee-is-done-inbend-The-siphon-sure-gets-a-lot-of-oohs-and-ahhhs.-brewgood-the1001bend-by-stackhousecoffee-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"We've partnered up with @wanderlusttours to show people how coffee is done #inbend The siphon sure gets a lot of oohs and ahhhs. #brewgood #the1001bend by stackhousecoffee\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Weve-partnered-up-with-@wanderlusttours-to-show-people-how-coffee-is-done-inbend-The-siphon-sure-gets-a-lot-of-oohs-and-ahhhs.-brewgood-the1001bend-by-stackhousecoffee-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Weve-partnered-up-with-@wanderlusttours-to-show-people-how-coffee-is-done-inbend-The-siphon-sure-gets-a-lot-of-oohs-and-ahhhs.-brewgood-the1001bend-by-stackhousecoffee-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Weve-partnered-up-with-@wanderlusttours-to-show-people-how-coffee-is-done-inbend-The-siphon-sure-gets-a-lot-of-oohs-and-ahhhs.-brewgood-the1001bend-by-stackhousecoffee-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Weve-partnered-up-with-@wanderlusttours-to-show-people-how-coffee-is-done-inbend-The-siphon-sure-gets-a-lot-of-oohs-and-ahhhs.-brewgood-the1001bend-by-stackhousecoffee.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demonstrating a siphon for people on a Wanderlust tour.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel like you\u2019re part of the tech and startup community?<\/strong> Most definitely.
