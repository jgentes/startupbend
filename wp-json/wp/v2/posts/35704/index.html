The process was hard to navigate, and ultimately left her infuriated and not only unlikely to recommend the company, but also probably apt to actively campaign against it.<\/p>\n<p>Luke Chambers, the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raaft.io\/\">Raaft<\/a>, understands these scenarios all too well, and takes a new approach that he believes will ultimately help retain customers or at least let them leave happy. Luke launched Raaft earlier this year with co-founder Cody Rogers. Their startup is one of the early stage companies pitching at EDCO PubTalk tonight.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cancelling is one option &#8230; <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Luke describes Raaft as a cancellation solution, essentially taking over the cancellation process for SaaS companies. Raaft aims to ask customers an easy series of questions about why they\u2019re cancelling and then provide them with options that may change their mind.<\/p>\n<p>Luke came upon the idea while he was working as the CTO for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/agree.com\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/Agree.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1538160955516000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg574mcKyKcZoilbRalcDf9NZNEQ\">Agree.com<\/a>. There the CEO had challenged the team to examine churn, which Luke says was relatively healthy, and gain some insights into how to retain even more customers. \u201cI did a lot of research into best practices for how to improve the cancellation process, and thought for certain someone had already built a tool that incorporated those.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No one had. So Chambers set forth to do just that. His solution looks likes this: When a user clicks the cancel button, they\u2019re met with the Raaft interface (which is customizable). They&#8217;re asked why they\u2019re cancelling and given multiple choices to easily click\u2014perhaps the product is too expensive or they didn\u2019t really use it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35705 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.33-500x196.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.33-500x196.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.33-768x301.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.33-1024x401.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.33.png 1158w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then kind of like a choose your own adventure, Raaft offers a quick series of options that address the customer\u2019s problem. It may be as simple as providing a discount or directing them to a product training so that they can take better advantage of their purchase. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get qualitative feedback. Of course, we don\u2019t want people to cancel, but if they do, we\u2019ll handle that as well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your right to cancel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The process is intentionally simple, which is actually a revolutionary approach to handling cancellations. Many subscription businesses don\u2019t make cancelling easy, and that\u2019s on purpose. Consider this v<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2985964\/comcast-cancel-ryan-block\/\">iral clip of one person&#8217;s experience trying to cancel<\/a> their cable. It&#8217;s insanely difficult. Chambers has a different view that works for customers and companies alike.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe take the position that it should be a customer\u2019s right to cancel,\u201d he says, adding that it\u2019s actually disrespectful to customers to make it hard. In the end, you want to keep your customers absolutely. But if they\u2019re bent on leaving, you need to dig into why and then address those issues&#8211;instead of forcing customers to stick around because cancelling is too much of a pain.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35706\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35706\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-35706 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.50-500x395.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.50-500x395.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-2018-09-27-12.23.50.png 617w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35706\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raaft notifications &#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The company already has some beta clients, including Chambers\u2019 former employer Agree.
