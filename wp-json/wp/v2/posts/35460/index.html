Testing Cookies at Local Stores&#8211;Get Some!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>If you like cookies and like supporting Bend startups, then today is your lucky day. <a href=\"https:\/\/thenobakecookieco.com\/\">The No-Bake Cookie Co.<\/a> is testing out all five of its no-bake cookies in Bend and Redmond-area Albertsons and Safeway grocery stores.<\/p>\n<p>The cookies are single servings and come in\u00a0chocolate, peanut butter, coconut macadamia, mocha and mint. They are gluten-free with no preservatives, no trans fat and no artificial anything. Eric Nealy, the company&#8217;s COO, says the test is running through the month of April.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If they determine they sold well, they will carry the cookies in all 144 Oregon stores,&#8221; Eric says. &#8220;They recently launched our 8 oz bakery tubs in all the stores and they are doing great. We are calling on all everyone we know locally to help The No-Bake Cookie Co. with this test by picking up a cookie or two.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-35463\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_4124-1-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_4124-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_4124-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_4124-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The cookies are at discounted price of 1.99 each. I have a soft spot in my heart for these cookies because they are very much like the first cookies I learned to make. If you&#8217;ve never seen the brand, you&#8217;d likely recognize the cookie &#8212; it&#8217;s usually oats and some kind of nut butter. I have a distinct memory of &#8220;cooking&#8221; these using a microwave (because I wasn&#8217;t allowed to use a stove) and then putting a stick of margarine with its foil wrapper in there and seeing flames. It all turned out fine.<\/p>\n<p>The Bend No-Bake Cookie Co. started small, with Carol Healy&#8211;Eric&#8217;s mom&#8211; making the treats to sell at the family&#8217;s convenience store.<\/p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https:\/\/bendmagazine.com\/no-bake-cookie-co-bend-company\/\">Bend magazine<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The cookies developed a fervent fan base among the market\u2019s customers, mostly from the Southeast neighborhood, who head there for burgers and other housemade dishes at the cafe-convenience store-gas station at the Reed Market Road and 15th Street roundabout.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Carol and her husband Tom then formed a cookie company, caught the gluten-free wave and were soon selling in Nordstrom. Now the cookies are in thousands of stores across the country. The business recently did a successful raise on CircleUp and is part of <a href=\"http:\/\/founderspad.com\/\">Founder&#8217;s Pad<\/a>, a Bend-based startup accelerator and early-stage fund.<\/p>\n<p>So if you have a craving for cookies, check them out.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/xT0xeMA62E1XIlup68\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/sesamestreet-xT0xeMA62E1XIlup68\">You.
