There&#8217;s also a host of other hardware and entrepreneurship classes you can take as well.<\/p>\n<p><em>But wait, there&#8217;s more.<\/em> ESPACE has also partnered with EDCO to offer an all-day patent and product licensing workshop on Monday, Oct. 10th. The workshop is aimed at inventors, product developers and investors. It&#8217;s also the same week as the <a href=\"http:\/\/bendvc.edcoinfo.com\/\">Bend Venture Conference<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/venture-out-festival-to-offer-110k-in-funds-for-outdoor-startups\/\">Venture Out<\/a> and a host of other entrepreneur-related events. So if you&#8217;re in town, might as well make a week of it.<\/p>\n<p>The patent workshop will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer a detailed explanation of the patent process and product licensing.<\/li>\n<li>Cover the benefits of working with a patent agent and a patent attorney.<\/li>\n<li>Provide the inventor with the knowledge needed to navigate the patent process and understand the value of intellectual property.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Presented by registered patent agent, Guy Letourneau, and patent attorney, Mark S. Hubert, the morning session will cover what an inventor needs to know to get a patent as well as the steps to getting a patent, according to the EDCO news release.<\/p>\n<p>Then in the afternoon, Craig Ladkin, investment banker for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.focusbankers.com\/\">Focus Investments<\/a>, will discuss the value of intellectual property to the inventor and the investor. Annette Kolodzie JD, PhD, will also talk about the pros and cons and legal issues of deciding to go the product licensing route.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will walk through provisions typically found in technology licensing agreements and discuss what the sections mean and why they are important from the perspective of both the party giving the license and the party getting the license,\u201d Kolodzie says.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Event details<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monday, October 10th, 2016<\/p>\n<p>8 a.m. to 4 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Doors open at 8 a.m. Program begins at 8:30 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Bend Parks and Rec Building<\/p>\n<p>799 SW Columbia St, Bend, OR 97702<\/p>\n<p>Coffee, muffins, box lunch, and refreshments will be provided.<\/p>\n<p><em>Pricing: Early bird &#8211; $149 (before 9\/23); regular pricing &#8211; $199 (after 9\/23)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/patent-and-product-licensing-workshop-tickets-27140041595\">Register here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of learning.
