Ventures<\/a>, a Bend-based firm owned by brothers Brian and Chris Azur, will be funding a venture round of at least $100,000 to be awarded to a growth stage outdoor product company. In addition, the Bend Radio Group will be sponsoring a $10,000 Breakout Award for an early stage company.<\/p>\n<p>Just an observation: The outdoor product folks seem to go big or go home and it&#8217;s generally the first. They launched this event last year &#8212; also on the Wednesday before BVC. They had three finalist companies pitch to a standing room only crowd of more than 250, and ultimately awarded the Robert Axle Project, a local manufacturer of axle adaptors for bike trailers, a $10,000 prize. Beaver Theodosakis, the founder of Prana, was the keynote speaker.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We received so much support last year that we decided to step it up,&#8221; Bracelin, co-founder of BOW said this morning. The 2016 event is supported by the Oregon Outdoor Alliance and EDCO. Some of the details are still be finalized &#8212; for instance, whether companies will need to Bend or Oregon based to compete &#8212; but BOW plans to begin accepting applications from interested startups mid-June. We&#8217;ll update you when we know more.<\/p>\n<p>Bracelin notes that startups can apply for both the Bend Venture Conference tracks and the Venture Out event.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32915\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32915\" style=\"width: 4128px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-32915\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150924_191627.jpg\" alt=\"The co-founders of SnoPlanks -- a BOW company -- in the PubTalk run up to last year's BVC.\" width=\"4128\" height=\"2322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150924_191627.jpg 4128w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150924_191627-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150924_191627-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4128px) 100vw, 4128px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The co-founders of SnoPlanks &#8212; a BOW company &#8212; in the PubTalk run up to last year&#8217;s BVC.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>FYI, the accelerator is <a href=\"http:\/\/bendoutdoorworx.com\/apply\/\">still taking applications for its next cohort through June 1<\/a>. More on that from BOW &#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Since 2014, BOW has worked with eight start-up outdoor companies providing them with mentorship from industry founders and an extended mentor group.\u00a0 Through a process of discovery meetings, analysis\u00a0and curriculum building, BOW determines company needs and provides guidance. The accelerator supports these companies by aligning them with additional resources needed to succeed, including legal, financial, marketing, logistics, sales, marketing, and product development.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re an outdoor startup, you got some applying to do. And hopefully we&#8217;ll see on one of the stages come October.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More startups. More funding. More fun.
