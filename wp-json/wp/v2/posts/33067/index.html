The pair&#8217;s poetic pitch for their startup earned them the $15,000 Bendbroadband Early Stage Award.<\/p>\n<p>To say thank you, SnoPlanks is offering a 25% discount on a their handmade bamboo snowboards or skis to anyone with a Bend zip code. The Give-Back-to-Bend promo begins Nov. 1 and runs through Thanksgiving. &#8220;The BVC really validated that we not only have a great product, but that the community believes that we could be successful in the long term,&#8221; Holmes says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33068\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33068\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120627-e1446060502273.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33068\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120627-e1446060502273-500x349.jpg\" alt=\"Branded!\" width=\"500\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120627-e1446060502273-500x349.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120627-e1446060502273-1024x714.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120627-e1446060502273.jpg 1806w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Branded!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Nicol adds they wanted to find a way to express their gratitude, and that giving back to the community is a core company value. &#8220;This is what we can do right now,&#8221; he says. So if you&#8217;ve been contemplating buying a new board and \u00a0you live in our fair city, jump on it.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Nicol and Holmes report they&#8217;ve already put their BVC prize to good use.\u00a0They ordered a new and much more efficient snowboard press, the machine that binds the bamboo together with the core and base. Their current machine requires four hours to press a board. They estimate the new one will cut that process down to 15 minutes. &#8220;It will let us ramp up to meet demand,&#8221; Nicol says. &#8220;It will automate some of the process, though every step still involves working with our hands.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33070\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33070\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120735-e1446060606525.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33070\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120735-e1446060606525-500x366.jpg\" alt=\"Making SnoPlanks by hand.\" width=\"500\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120735-e1446060606525-500x366.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120735-e1446060606525-1024x751.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151027_120735-e1446060606525-800x586.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33070\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Making SnoPlanks by hand.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Holmes added that the BVC money is &#8220;going such a long way to help us build out our brand.&#8221; In addition to the new equipment, the startup is using the funds for marketing. SnoPlanks has primarily grown organically. They anticipate that this winter could be a milestone as they laser in on getting the word out about their products beyond Bend. &#8220;Getting exposure in reputable environments is critical,&#8221; Holmes says.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re planning a trip to the SIA trade show in January. They&#8217;ve already delivered 160 boards to Deschutes Brewery for its Red Chair promotions. And they have a professional team ready to ride.
