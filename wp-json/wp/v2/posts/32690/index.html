The pair tapped into many of Oregon\u2019s startup resources, taking advantage of Portland accelerator programs and local angel and VC funding, eventually raising more than $850,000.<\/p>\n<p>A favorite of creative workers who want a simple way to share unwieldy documents, videos and images, Droplr is now looking to grow its client base inside bigger companies and tip into profitability. BendTECH caught up with Bryant recently to get the update.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/droplr.com\/\">Droplr<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Co-founders:<\/strong> Josh Bryant and Levi Nunnink<br \/>\n<strong>Started:<\/strong> 2009<br \/>\n<strong>Employees:<\/strong> 5<br \/>\n<strong>Headquarters:<\/strong> Bend<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do describe Droplr?<\/strong> It\u2019s sharing made simple. You can turn anything into a link. We started it because we were tired of wasting time trying to share and collaborate on large files with our colleagues. My co-founder Levi and I were using all sorts of tools and still having a hard time sending stuff back and forth easily. So we made something ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32691\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32691\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Josh-Bryant.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-32691\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Josh-Bryant.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Bryant, co-founder and CEO of Droplr. \" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Josh-Bryant.jpg 400w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Josh-Bryant-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Josh Bryant, co-founder and CEO of Droplr.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve had a busy two years since moving to Bend. What have you been up to?<\/strong>\u00a0We left our full-time jobs as developers in 2013 and did the Bend Venture Conference that fall. We went through the Portland Seed Fund program and we were part of the Portland Incubator Experiment in 2014 and still have desks there. The latter was especially valuable. Rick Turoczy (PIE\u2019s co-founder) had contacted us to see if we were interested. He had been a Droplr user and then discovered we were in Oregon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve garnered a loyal following of agency creatives. Is that your target market?<\/strong> Yes, they\u2019re part of it. That\u2019s where our organic growth really happened &#8212; our first couple hundred thousand users came from that space. Now we have a split that\u2019s about one-third individuals, one-third agencies and one-third smaller teams inside larger companies.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/iPhone-6-Coffee-Table1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-32693\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/iPhone-6-Coffee-Table1-500x333.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone-6-Coffee-Table[1]\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/iPhone-6-Coffee-Table1-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/iPhone-6-Coffee-Table1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/iPhone-6-Coffee-Table1-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/iPhone-6-Coffee-Table1.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>You recently launched a freemium model. Why?<\/strong> In May, <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/04\/file-sharing-service-droplr-is-going-freemium\/\">we began letting people download the product and share files for free<\/a>. However, the links you share self destruct after a week. The Droplr Pro plan ($8.33\/mo) lets you create permanent links and gives you access to additional features such as private drops and password-protected files. Our hope is that people will try the free service, realize the efficiency and ease it brings to their work and not only sign up for an individual account, but also introduce their teams and companies to Droplr.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s up next for Droplr?<\/strong> We\u2019ve done the fundraising and the startup programs. Right now we\u2019re focused on growth and settling on a repeatable model for sales and marketing. And we\u2019re moving toward $1 million in ARR, which will be a nice milestone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Droplr and its co-founders Josh Bryant and Levi Nunnink moved from California to Bend two years ago in search of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":32694,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[61,15],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32690"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32690"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32690\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32695,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32690\/revisions\/32695"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/32694"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32690"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32690"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32690"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
