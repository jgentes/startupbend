Tyrone introduced his wireless speaker with flames that dance to the music at the conference. He was coming off the heels of <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/back-it-like-its-hot-bend-inventor-debuts-fireside-audiobox-on-kickstarter\/\">a successful Kickstarter, which raised $38,000 last summer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, interest in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firesideaudiobox.com\/\">Fireside Audiobox<\/a> has ignited. It&#8217;s hot! Damn hot! (Does anyone get this movie reference? Anyone?) Retailers <em>want<\/em> it. I recently chatted with Tyrone to learn more about his progress with his fun invention that has transformed into a real business.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33979\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33979\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33979\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image-1-500x333.png\" alt=\"The Fireside Audiobox. \" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" data-wp-pid=\"33979\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image-1-500x333.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image-1-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image-1-1024x682.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image-1-800x533.png 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image-1.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33979\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Fireside Audiobox.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Here are a few of the most recent developments:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grey Street, the company that makes the Fireside Audiobox, received an order for 10,000 units, from a major retailer.<\/li>\n<li>Thanks to this gigantic order, Tyrone had to figure out how to make 10,000 units &#8212; fast. He&#8217;d been making the units here, but doesn&#8217;t have the capacity to scale production that quickly.<\/li>\n<li>So he reached out to a friend at RuffWear for guidance. And because people in Bend&#8217;s business community remain <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/forbes-highlights-bends-outdoor-startups-and-the-role-of-friendliness-in-our-ecosystem\/\">exceptional helpful as a rule<\/a>, that friend connected him with a U.S. company in China that specifically helps businesses find appropriate manufacturers.<\/li>\n<li>Then Tyrone went to China for two weeks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It was a productive and eye-opening visit. Thanks to the aforementioned connection, he was able to set up a relationship with a manufacturer there in short order, and is now awaiting samples of the Fireside Audiobox to approve.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The interesting thing about that monster order was that it got me to pull the trigger and go to China,&#8221; Tyrone says. Up until now, he&#8217;s been making the products here, but he didn&#8217;t have the bandwidth to make that many that fast<\/p>\n<p>Tyrone says he&#8217;s still figuring out the details of that large contact and whether moving forward on it makes sense. In meantime, he&#8217;s now set up to fulfill his 200 Kickstarter orders and primed to manufacture more Fireside Audioboxes. (In consumer products startupland, getting a giant order is great. However, determining how to fulfill a giant order <em>and<\/em> still make a profit is even better).<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s received a lot of interest, especially from luxury home goods retailers. Tyrone earned an invitation to the Worlds Fair Nano event in San Francisco in January, a curated show of new technology, art and more. He&#8217;ll\u00a0also be the at the Las Vegas Market, a furniture show, and in the Eureka Park section of CES. Tyrone may actually live at trade shows in January.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All of the interest we&#8217;ve had so far has been inbound,&#8221; Tyrone says. &#8220;Lots of retailers are reaching out, including Sharper Image and Touch of Modern. I think they think our product is unique, and something that their customers will want.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tyrone is also considering fundraising to help Fireside Audiobox expand more quickly. It&#8217;s been a busy couple months &#8212; and something tells us that business for this unique startup is just heating up.
