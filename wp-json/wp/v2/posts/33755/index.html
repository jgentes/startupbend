He&#8217;s noted that regular jogging strollers were fairly restrictive in terms of what you can do with them, and that the basic design hasn&#8217;t been innovated for decades.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The very best stroller in the world still sucks to run with. You can\u2019t go on trails. You can\u2019t go to the beach. You can\u2019t go on hardpack. You\u2019re pretty limited for the money you spend. You can go to Safeway and Starbucks, but you can\u2019t really do anything active,\u201d Warne told <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bendbroadband.com\/business\/2015\/09\/15\/catching-up-with-kidrunner\/\">BendBroadband Business<\/a>\u00a0last fall.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33756\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33756\" style=\"width: 334px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-33756 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kidrunner-1-334x500.jpg\" alt=\"kidrunner\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kidrunner-1-334x500.jpg 334w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kidrunner-1-768x1151.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kidrunner-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kidrunner-1-800x1199.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kidrunner-1.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33756\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">KidRunner&#8217;s lightweight kid jogger.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As someone who spent a lot of time running with &#8212; and cursing at &#8212; my jogging stroller, I can tell you that the design really does have an appeal. Instead of pushing a stroller, you connect a KidRunner to your waist with a belt and then pull it behind you. King <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JbG3-s6gMdU\">won a 10k race pulling his daughter in one<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The company has\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-kidrunner-sprints-toward-summer-launch-of-hands-free-stroller\/\">picked up steam over the past two year<\/a>s. Warne landed a spot on the concept stage of the 2014 BVC, hired a team of ambassadors (parent-runners and professional athletes) to spread the word about the project and partnered with Central Oregon-based Composite Approach to manufacture the product.<\/p>\n<p>The company has a limited number of pre-orders ready for after Shark Tank airs. You <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kidrunners.com\/\">can pre-order one off the KidRunner website<\/a>. The joggers cost $1,200, and deliveries will be made within six months. &#8220;We are the only kid jogger made in the U.S.\/Bend, Ore. with advanced, sports oriented materials and technology like carbon, fiber glass, etc.,&#8221; Warne says.<\/p>\n<p>He adds:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00a0KidRunner is creating a new, &#8220;sport&#8221; space in this market more like skis, snowboards, mountain bikes, etc which sell for $1,200.00 minimums and are often used fewer times per year, etc than a kid jogger, which can be used year round for several years and multiple kids. Enthusiastic, early adopters will be included in a fun and interesting community process of manufacturing, etc. Think Tesla cars, not BoB strollers!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The company is spending this week getting ready for the publicity rush, updating the website, tuning its e-commerce platform and ramping up its social media.
