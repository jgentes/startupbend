OSU-Cascades  Creates Oregon Startup Checklist"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>A team of students led by <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam Krynicki, executive director of the OSU-Cascades Innovation Co-Lab, has created a comprehensive list of the resources available for Oregon startups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Called the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1-iGdBhx-hqBRsHRpj2ogr02BwhEpHvso_5MkQ0s3Kow\/edit#\">Oregon Startup Checklist<\/a>, the document is a &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">centralized, online resource that helps entrepreneurs find help, funding, and tools. Unlike traditional business books that can be hundreds of pages long, this document is an intense, 20+ \u00a0page look at what it takes to start and grow a business. Unlike blogs and other online resources, it covers a wide variety of topics all in one place.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam created an initial version of the checklist in 2010 while living in Pittsburgh. At the time, it was about five pages long and included a list of common tools for e-commerce companies. He says that over the ensuing years, multiple collaborators, students, and colleagues suggested new resources, which he then added to the checklist.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to this spring and the document gained new life in Oregon. Several OSU-Cascades students edited the startup checklist as part of a Project Management Class \u00a0to make it more relevant for businesses here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the checklist introduction:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the project, they surveyed local startups, and found that almost every startup had questions or issues with finding funding.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students \u00a0used this information to reorganize the checklist and looked up multiple funding sources in Oregon. \u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OSU-Cascades students also added information about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where can entrepreneurs learn about registering a business in Oregon?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where can an entrepreneur get help?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What funding is available for startups?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where can entrepreneurs find more information about hiring employees?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some regulatory issues that Oregon startups need to address, and where can entrepreneurs find more information about them?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where can entrepreneurs find out more information about taxes?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where can people find information about local events for innovators and entrepreneurs?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The checklist is a living, changing document.
