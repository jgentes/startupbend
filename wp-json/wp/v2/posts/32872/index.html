Goebel, who now lives part-time in Bend, was interested in diversifying the company\u2019s portfolio and exploring local tech opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>More from the release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Because of his depth of experience in working with manufacturers with global sales organizations, Goebel immediately understood the solution that Lead Method provides to companies selling through third-party distributors and value-added resellers (VARs). Such companies often have little visibility into what happens with their sales leads and the potential opportunities that are in their pipelines.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was in the energy business, this was an ongoing significant problem.\u201d Goebel says. \u201cI saw right away that LeadMethod had developed an easy-to-use product that gives marketing and sales departments actionable information about their third-party sales teams \u2013and most importantly helps boost revenue.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Texagon made its investment in LeadMethod as part of the company\u2019s seed round. The firm doesn&#8217;t report specific investment amounts. LeadMethod already has several clients using its software. The startup continues to fundraise, with the aim of using the money to build out its product and grow its team.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32875\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32875\" style=\"width: 263px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Justin-Johnson-LeadMethod-photo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-32875\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Justin-Johnson-LeadMethod-photo-500x333.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Johnson, LeadMethod CEO.\" width=\"263\" height=\"175\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Justin-Johnson-LeadMethod-photo-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Justin-Johnson-LeadMethod-photo-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Justin-Johnson-LeadMethod-photo.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32875\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Justin Johnson, LeadMethod CEO.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cWe are genuinely excited to be working with Texagon,\u201d says LeadMethod CEO Justin Johnson. \u201cTexagon\u2019s investment will help us to continue to improve our product and grow the business.\u201d\u00a0LeadMethod has also recently <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/cascade-angels-invests-100000-in-leadmethod\/\">raised capital from Cascade Angels <\/a>and the Portland Seed Fund.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of fundraising happening in Bend lately.
