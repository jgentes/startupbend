Today I had the opportunity to sit down with Carrie Percich, the company&#8217;s recruiter to talk about G5&#8217;s growth and get her thoughts on how to best recruit tech talent here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I get to recruit for one of the best companies to work for in the one of the best places to live,&#8221; Percich says.<\/p>\n<p>In the four years that Percich has been with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getg5.com\/\">G5<\/a>, the company has grown from 44 employees to 176. In fact, they have six new people starting this month, including a new CTO. So how does Percich, who previously spent 14 years as a recruiter for Volt, maintain a robust pipeline of potential employees?<\/p>\n<p>She offered 4 tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sell Bend\u00a0<\/strong>We happen to live in a Northwest mountain paradise, and Percich isn&#8217;t shy about promoting Bend lifestyle. She regularly posts articles that tout Bend&#8217;s quality of life and photos of events happening here to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GetG5\"> company&#8217;s FB page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Promote Your Culture<\/strong>\u00a0&#8220;Culture is huge,&#8221; she says. Percich again makes use of social media to talk about G5&#8217;s work culture, everything from benefits (2.5 weeks of vacation to start sounds nice) \u00a0and community involvement to the office dogs and beer keg.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stay in touch<\/strong>\u00a0People often reach out to Percich because they want to move here, and they&#8217;re looking for a way to make it happen. She maintains a deep bench of candidates, and checks back with people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Play nice <\/strong>The company was hit hard a few years ago when a Portland tech company hired away most of their engineering team. Percich makes it a personal rule to not poach employees from other employers. &#8220;If I contact someone on LinkedIn who already has a job, I&#8217;ll just ask them if know someone who has skills similar to theirs,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They might then note that their looking. But I won&#8217;t ask them.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What&#8217;s been your experience hiring here?
