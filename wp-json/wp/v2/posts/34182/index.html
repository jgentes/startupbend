First, just do it.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/julie-harrelson-and-sarah-poole-on-starting-up-healthy-twinkies-and-hats\/\">Sarah Pool, Founder and CEO of Pacific SuperFood Snacks, says to simply begin<\/a>. &#8220;Just do it. Really, the worst that could happen is the business doesn\u2019t work out (which your ego and bank account can recover from). But the rewards on the flip side are innumerable. My favorite,\u00a0the opportunity to offer a product or service that positively impacts others\u2019 lives,&#8221; Pool says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33836\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33836\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33836\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0221-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Harrelson and Sarah Pool at Bend's Women of the Year event. \" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-wp-pid=\"33836\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0221-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0221-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0221-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0221-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0221.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie Harrelson and Sarah Pool at Bend&#8217;s Women of the Year event.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>2. Ask the right questions before you start.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/julieselfie-seven-peaks-corey-schmid-on-what-to-ask-before-you-start-up-and-eating-dirt\/\">Corey Schmid, venture partner at Seven Peaks, says that before you do<\/a>\u00a0just do it, ask yourself some hard questions, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you solving a real problem and delivering a solution that your envisioned customers truly can\u2019t live without? Have you even asked enough of them (i.e. market research) to be confident that this is true?<\/li>\n<li>How big is your market? If your business will serve only you and a few of your closest friends, it\u2019s probably not a sustainable or scalable business. Market size and dynamics are rarely within your control, so understand this very well and size and scope the opportunity appropriately.<\/li>\n<li>How will your business be funded? Do everything within your control to run on very little cash in the early days, until you\u2019ve validated that your product\/solution can gain traction by delivering sales or usage by your customers. This will also show maturity and resourcefulness to future investors when you ask for their support, and precious capital, to grow your business.<\/li>\n<li>Why now, and why <em>you<\/em>? Authenticity, humility, coach-ability, expertise, and a kickass capacity for resolve to wade through tough decisions and problems, are imperative in a successful entrepreneur.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33926\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33926\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33926\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0222-1-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Harrelson, of Cascade Angels, and Corey Schmid, of Seven Peaks Ventures. \" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-wp-pid=\"33926\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0222-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0222-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0222-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0222-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0222-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33926\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie Harrelson, of Cascade Angels, and Corey Schmid, of Seven Peaks Ventures.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>3.

They\u2019re in it right along with you. This is not a solo game; you will not have all the answers, and the minute you think you do there is a problem. Be confident, but listen (really listen) to the people working with you, supporting you and those who have been there before.

She says to &#8220;keep a low personal overhead so you have options.&#8221; This is so crucial.
