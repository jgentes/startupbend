Not only is Gonser keen on helping founders launch and grow their startups, but he told GeekWire that he specifically liked the Bend-based VC firm&#8217;s geography and &#8216;rise of the rest&#8217; approach.<\/p>\n<p>The latter refers to the idea that startups can &#8212; and should &#8212; launch and grow outside of expected places such as Silicon Valley. It&#8217;s good for communities, good for founders and as Gosner and Seven Peaks are exploring, hopefully good for investors.<\/p>\n<p>From GeekWire:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think smart people will realize that the gains in baseline standard of living are so much higher just one hour away from major metro areas, that we will see a flock of really smart founders decide to build the next great company in a location that allows a better balance, and is actually much more efficient,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSeven Peaks Ventures shares a similar feeling that technology has moved to a point where you no longer have to move your company to a big city to succeed,\u201d said Gonser. He added that he anticipates hubs like Bend, only an hour\u2019s flight to the San Francisco Bay Area, will become increasingly popular locales for young startups.<\/p>\n<p>How awesome was it to find a high caliber team (led) by a seasoned VC from the Bay Area living in Bend, already creating the best venture capital opportunity for startups in the Pacific Northwest, where my roots are,\u201d Gonser said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dinovendetti\">Vendetti<\/a>, a former partner at Bay Partners in Silicon Valley and Vulcan Ventures in Seattle, is certainly excited to have another experienced entrepreneur on the Seven Peaks\u2019 team.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTom shares our belief that category-leading companies are being built in thriving regional markets across the country and in particular in the West, where easy access to the Bay Area has made markets like Seattle, Portland and Salt Lake City very attractive to both entrepreneurs and investors,\u201d said Vendetti in a release.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You can learn more about Gosner from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2016\/tom-gosner\/\">story here<\/a>.
