Survey Asks Employers Whether Local PM Program Could Help"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>How do you become a product manager or product marketer? In many cases, it\u2019s via several years of on-the-job learning to master the skills you need for this key position.<\/p>\n<p>However, some business and education leaders in the community are considering creating a product management certificate or degree program to fast track this process, and possibly fill a local talent gap as well. The group includes Cari Baldwin and Bruce Cleveland, the duo behind BendPoly; Yong Bakos, the new OSU-Cascades CS professor; Matt Abrams, with Seven Peaks; and Libby Unger, founder and CEO of Lumineau, a management consulting firm.<\/p>\n<p>This process is just getting started. First, the group wants to know whether Central Oregon employers are in need of product managers. They&#8217;re asking companies to take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/r\/2WS657R\">this 10 question survey regarding the demand for the position, interest in product interns and their willingness to support a certificate or a degree program<\/a>.\u00a0Filling out the survey will just take five minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Then depending on the ultimate need, there&#8217;s a possibility that a product management program could be housed at OSU-Cascades Innovation Center for Entrepreneurship. So please take the time to complete the survey, and who knows &#8212; you could be helping Central Oregon take the first steps toward becoming a future hub of product management training and talent.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/r\/2WS657R\">TAKE THE SURVEY.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How do you become a product manager or product marketer?
