You can find the <a href=\"http:\/\/volcanoveggies.com\">Volcano Veggies<\/a> farm downtown on Second Street.<\/p>\n<p>Bendites have been enjoying leafy greens from their indoor aquaponics system\u00a0since last year, when they also won the concept stage prize at the Bend Venture Conference and we featured the company as <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50startups-volcano-veggies-plants-seeds-of-growth\/\">one of our first #50startups<\/a>. Their module is a unique closed system where an army of tilapia produce fertilizer for the plants. Growing inside, they don&#8217;t need to worry about pests, use any kind of pesticides, or fret about snow.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2252.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-32537 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2252-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2252-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2252-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The winnings from the BVC and a group of new investors helped fund the development of the second module prototype, which successfully increased productivity and energy efficiency, and still kept costs low compared to competitors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have hit the optimal growth rate to make this a profitable business, and we are currently focused on bringing new products to market and making this scale,&#8221; says co-founder Jimmy Sbarra. Volcano Veggies also became the third aquaponics farm in the world to be certified organic and this designation opens new markets and potential for growth.<\/p>\n<p>This summer, they&#8217;re expanding their product offerings to include kale, basil, mint, and cilantro. While their subscription service and sales at local markets are increasing, they&#8217;re now \u00a0also offering a CSA (community supported agriculture) share where people can get regular deliveries and support the company&#8217;s\u00a0growth with an annual membership. In the future, they plan to vary the greens by including spinach, arugula and other varieties of lettuce and add options for\u00a0strawberries, cucumbers, and tomatoes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/11269783_691398110965093_7285498127473887602_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32538\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/11269783_691398110965093_7285498127473887602_n-500x376.jpg\" alt=\"11269783_691398110965093_7285498127473887602_n\" width=\"500\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/11269783_691398110965093_7285498127473887602_n-500x376.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/11269783_691398110965093_7285498127473887602_n-800x601.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/11269783_691398110965093_7285498127473887602_n.jpg 852w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Their current success wasn&#8217;t without some challenges, including some literally bad seeds. But the duo feels they are well on our way to raising $250,000 through equity, convertible notes, traditional\u00a0financing, and CSA memberships. They&#8217;re\u00a0also are considering\u00a0a kickstarter campaign, a community public offering (CPO), or maybe both. A CPO would allow non-accredited investors to participate.\u00a0&#8220;This time around, we aren&#8217;t begging for charity from potential investors.
