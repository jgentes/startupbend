What if you could also use it to fuel your car or truck? Onboard Dynamics is aiming to commercialize a technology that provides for natural gas compression on board your vehicle, basically allowing you to refuel anywhere there\u2019s a low-pressure natural gas line.<\/p>\n<p>So, BBQ some burgers. Then use the same source of gas that fuels your grill to fill up your Ford F-150. BendTECH caught up with Onboard Dynamics CEO Rita Hansen to hear about her whirlwind year of fundraising, OBDI&#8217;s recent visit to Detroit and what\u2019s next for this Bend-based startup.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onboarddynamics.com\/\">Onboard Dynamics<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Started:<\/strong> Oct. 2013<br \/>\n<strong>Founders:<\/strong> Chris Hagen, CTO; Rita Hansen, CEO; and Jeff Witwer, VP of Engineering<br \/>\n<strong>Employees:<\/strong> 4<br \/>\n<strong>Headquarters:<\/strong> Bend, OR<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31790\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31790\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141201_150036.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31790\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141201_150036-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Rita Hansen, OBDI CEO\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31790\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rita Hansen, OBDI CEO<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How did this all start?<\/strong> Chris came up with the original concept about five years ago when he was working as an assistant research professor at Colorado State University. (Hagen is now at OSU-Cascades). His research has been focused on energy systems, advanced internal combustion engines and alternative fuels. He basically questioned whether you could use the power of a vehicle\u2019s combustion engine to compress natural gas that could then be used as the vehicle\u2019s transportation fuel. He received a $1 million award through the Department of Energy\u2019s ARPA-e program, which aims to bring new energy technologies to market, to build a prototype to do just that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And Onboard Dynamics was born from that research?<\/strong> Yes. Chris completed the proof of concept; he built out a truck with an onboard CNG compressor. We know it works. So now we\u2019re at the point of figuring out how to commercialize this technology and ensure that it\u2019s not just an academic exercise.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/z8Ydewj3YaM\" width=\"650\" height=\"396\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s happened in OBDI\u2019s first year?<\/strong> We applied for &#8212; and received &#8212; $2.8 million in federal funding from ARPA-e. That came with a 20% cost-sharing requirement that we raise an additional $720,000. So we\u2019ve been raising that, and we\u2019re nearly there. We\u2019re not at a place where traditional VCs would invest. Our funding\/cost share match requirement so far has been met from gap funding programs like Oregon BEST and ONAMI and waived indirect fees from OSU for continued services to be performed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your target market?<\/strong> We\u2019re really looking at small commercial fleets, say a local UPS or county road departments. In fact, Deschutes County Road Department will be one of our first pilot customers. Companies with fleets of 50 or more vehicles could afford to build their own CNG stations. But these cost about $1 million to build. There are 30,000 smaller, private fleets in the U.S. that would like to use natural gas, but don\u2019t have a place to fuel up and can\u2019t afford to build their own stations. There are only 13 public and private CNG stations in Oregon. But with our technology, you\u2019d be able to refuel with any low-pressure natural gas line. The infrastructure is already there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is natural gas widely available?<\/strong> There are 673,000 homes and businesses served by low-pressure natural gas lines just in Oregon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your competition?<\/strong> It\u2019s basically maintaining the status quo. With prices of gas near $3 per gallon, people may not be thinking about alternative fuels. But the oil market is volatile. Natural gas is produced domestically, and it\u2019s much cheaper &#8212; about $1 per gallon gasoline equivalent &#8212; especially when it comes from your own home or business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What were you doing in Detroit?<\/strong> Well we recently met with the big three automakers (Chrysler, Ford and GM). All of them produce bi-fuel vehicles today. We need to choose an engine to work with and we\u2019d love to collaborate with one of them. We definitely received a positive response to our idea, and we\u2019re now having follow-up meetings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next for ObDI?<\/strong> We want to be ready to go with a commercial product in 18 months. We\u2019ll be hiring. And there\u2019s some fundraising still to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Any words of wisdom for other startups?<\/strong> I think the key is to not be overwhelmed by the enormity of what you\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s like climbing a mountain. You break it down into pieces. You first make it to base camp. There\u2019s a tendency for startups to get distracted, and you need to focus on working toward that next goal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know that natural gas line that serves your house or small business?
