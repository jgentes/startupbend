Here&#8217;s their short pitch:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re asking you to join us as we create Built Oregon, a platform designed to celebrate the statewide network of entrepreneurs and innovators building Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>With your help, we can afford to build a website designed to highlight stories of founders and companies through compelling narrative and engaging content &#8212; with a distinct focus on storytelling, both written and interactive. Our events will allow you to experience those stories &#8212; and meet those entrepreneurs &#8212; firsthand.<\/p>\n<p>Built Oregon tells stories. Stories that inspire entrepreneurs. Stories that create connections between business and support organizations. Stories that increase awareness of companies around our state. Stories to be shared beyond our state lines.<\/p>\n<p>With your support, we will be able to tell these uniquely Oregon stories and create a new online home for our collaborative startup ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re doing this because we believe in Oregon entrepreneurs. And we&#8217;re hoping you&#8217;ll join us.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping out, please support their campaign or reach out to us here at BendTECH and we&#8217;ll work with you to get involved!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our friends over in Portland are doing something amazing.
