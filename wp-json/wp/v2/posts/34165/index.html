As noted, the conference&#8217;s big winner was Hubb, a startup that makes event management software.<\/p>\n<p>Founder and CEO Allie Magyar delivered a powerful, polished pitch that earned her compliments from the panelists and rave reviews in the audience. It also earned her a whopping $2,515,000 in investment via a combination of awards.

People in the Liberty Theater crowd started wondering if maybe everyone there was going to get money, like not just the startups. One person commented that it was like Oprah&#8217;s Christmas special. What if we all got free cars?!<\/p>\n<p>Last year, the conference funding totaled about $950,000. So for people keeping track, that&#8217;s a 300% increase from 2015. Ten startups received funding this year.

Sudara makes beautiful pajama pants, sewn by women in India who are survivors of the sex slave trade. It&#8217;s a pretty good reason to buy some more lounge wear. Founder Shannon Keith gave a passionate pitch about the social impact of her startup, which has also made some pretty amazing business progress.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.outdoorproject.com\/\">The Outdoor Project<\/a>, another growth stage competitor, earned a <strong>$150,000<\/strong> investment from Cascade Angels. The Outdoor Project is a media platform dedicated to outdoor sports. Tyson Gillard, co-founder and CEO, also grew up in Bend so it was fun to see him on his hometown stage.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.opconnect.com\/press\/\">OpConnect<\/a>, another of the SI track companies, won $100,00 and <a href=\"http:\/\/hemexhealth.com\/\">Hemex Health<\/a> won $50,000.

As a Bend local, I loved hearing Shannon Keith, founder of Bend-based Sudara, talk about how her lounge wear company empowers survivors of India&#8217;s sex trade by providing them with living wage jobs and employment training. The product is stunning, and business is booming: her revenues are set to hit $4 million this year. As previously mentioned, she earned a well-deserved $250,000 investment from Craft3. We&#8217;re excited to watch Sudara&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Women entrepreneurs, women keynotes, women investors!\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of the 15 founders pitching over the past two days, six were women. Two keynote speakers? Also women, both in tech. Julie Harrelson, of Cascade Angels, and Julianne Brands, of OAF, were handing out big checks from investors. A shout out to Stephanie Senner, of BendBroadband, who also handed out the $15k early stage prize, and champions so much startup and tech activity in Bend.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34162\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34162\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34162 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0404-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"img_0404\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-wp-pid=\"34162\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0404-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0404-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0404-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0404-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Loni Stark, keynote speaker from Adobe, with a great slide that got big laughs.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>At time <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/19\/the-first-comprehensive-study-on-women-in-venture-capital\/\">when only 18% of startup founders and 12% of partners at corporate VC firms and accelerators are women<\/a>, it was inspiring to see so many accomplished, awesome women holding down the stage and frankly, raking in &#8212; and doling out &#8212; the funding. I don&#8217;t need to tell you that businesses and investors do better when everyone is at the table. So yes. Yes to this and more of this.<\/p>\n<p>So that was a fun week. If you happened to attend the unConference, Venture Out Festival and BVC then you heard no less than 40 startup pitches, drank at least 5 free beers and probably met dozens of people.<\/p>\n<p>One last thought before you put your feet up: There&#8217;s been much talk over the past few years about the ability of small(er) places to sustain big businesses. People write about it. T<a href=\"http:\/\/www.riseofrest.com\/\">hey drive around in buses and talk about it<\/a>. This week, we got to see it in action right here in Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The BVC is a conference, yes, so you get to see inspiring keynote speakers and eat all sorts of free pastries. But it&#8217;s also a prime example of how our growing Oregon and Bend startup ecosystem can launch, and then support and build industry-leading, game-changing, world-improving businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Sit for a moment with the fact that Oregon investors came together and invested more than $3 million in regional companies. That&#8217;s needle moving stuff, not just for the startups that got funded, but for the next generation of Oregon entrepreneurs who are debating whether they can\/should start their business here. They can. And they should.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations to everyone who pitched and participated!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 2016 Bend Venture Conference is officially wrapped up and the big headline is $3.76 MILLION in funding was awarded, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":34157,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7,16,12,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34165"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34165"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34165\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":34166,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34165\/revisions\/34166"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34157"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34165"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34165"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=34165"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
