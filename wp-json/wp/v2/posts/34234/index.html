That seems to be the case with Ryan Doherty and Zach Hines, co-founders of <a href=\"https:\/\/ripclear.com\/\">Ripclear, a Bend startup that creates (actually invented) adhesive ski goggle protectors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Ryan was working at Mt. Bachelor as an inventory controller in 2013, basically making sure that the resort\u2019s various lodges had all the food and beverages they needed to serve their customers. An avid snowboarder, he\u2019d often snowboard between the mountain\u2019s lodges and buildings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was scratching up to three or four pairs of goggles a year,\u201d he says. He thought that there had to be something he could adhere to the front \u2013 like a cellphone screen cover \u2013 that would prevent the damage. But after a lot of Internet searching, he found exactly nothing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo we decided to make it,\u201d Ryan says. Did he have deep experience in the eyeware industry? No. Was he familiar with plastics or manufacturing? Nope. But like many successful\u00a0entrepreneurs, he and Zach just dug in, made themselves the experts and are now selling RipClear goggle protectors across the country.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34235\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34235\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34235\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ripclear-SIA-2016-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan and Zach at the 2016 SIA show. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-wp-pid=\"34235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ripclear-SIA-2016-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ripclear-SIA-2016-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ripclear-SIA-2016-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ripclear-SIA-2016-800x450.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ripclear-SIA-2016.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ryan and Zach at the 2016 SIA show.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>A big plastic experiment<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The idea seemed easy enough: Create an adhesive goggle cover that would prevent your lens from scratching. But when Ryan and Zach started calling around to plastic manufacturers, the companies told them that making a plastic that would directly adhere wasn\u2019t possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe basically had to find our own plastic, one that would bend and stick,\u201d Ryan says. They tested hundreds of plastics before finally landing on one that works. They designed Ripclear so that you can peel off one paper to stick them to your goggles, and then peel off the second so that you don\u2019t smudge the new lens in the process. That design is now patented.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-34237\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"f1m\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-wp-pid=\"34237\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-768x770.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-1022x1024.jpg 1022w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-800x802.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/F1M-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The pair, who were friends in high school back in Michigan, had some immediate interest from Dicks Sporting Goods. They ran a small Kickstarter to raise money for their first Dick\u2019s order, and bootstrapped the rest of the company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So many markets<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The market has met Ripclear with excitement. \u201cWe mostly just have to get our product in front of people; and they have an \u2018aha\u2019 moment, like why didn\u2019t this exist before,\u201d Ryan says. The startup has sold 10,000 units in its first year, with a one-pack selling for $15 and a three-pack for $30.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest surprise \u2013 and challenge so far \u2013 has been determining where to take the product next. Ripclear has garnered interest from the military, who could use the solution to protect eyewear for soldiers; motocross and downhill mountain biking companies and many others.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a three-year growth plan,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get into snow mobile, hockey and football visors, and we\u2019d also like to start selling in New Zealand and Australia, so that we can do business year round.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Starting the company in Bend has provided not only a venue for testing the product right in Ryan\u2019s background, but also invaluable connections from the town\u2019s growing outdoor startup community. \u201cI think it\u2019s been so awesome,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had no idea that there was such a community here.
