Sometimes a small amount can lead to big change. That&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening with one of Bend&#8217;s more delightful projects right now, Awesome Bend.<\/p>\n<p>The group awarded Serenity Johnson a $1,000 grant to make her idea of expanding Little Free Libraries (aka the cutest things ever) to the neglected parts of Bend a reality. Johnson was one of five finalists pitching their ideas Tuesday night at the Deschutes Brewery Tap Room. The grant came from ten $100 donations from Awesome Bend trustees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This project [will] promote one of the most valuable things we have\u2014literacy,\u201d said Johnson.\u00a0\u201cWithout reading, we would not be able to do math, drive, shop, learn, and live a functioning life.These libraries [will] not only bring the community closer, but also make the gift of learning\u00a0accessible to each and every person in Bend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Johnson is a senior at Summit High School and just moved to Bend a month ago. Our hats off to her for diving in and making her new home a better place. Johnson accepted the prize from Awesome Bend&#8217;s student trustee Olivia Brumwell, a junior at\u00a0Bend High.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33052\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33052\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Awesome-Bend-Winner-Oct-2015.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-33052 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Awesome-Bend-Winner-Oct-2015-500x376.jpg\" alt=\"Awesome Bend Winner Oct 2015\" width=\"500\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Awesome-Bend-Winner-Oct-2015-500x376.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Awesome-Bend-Winner-Oct-2015-1024x770.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Awesome-Bend-Winner-Oct-2015-800x601.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33052\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Serenity Johnson, left, and Olivia Brumwell, right.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cWe love that our young people are getting involved and making a difference in our community,\u201d\u00a0says Pam Stevenson, Awesome Bend\u2019s co-founder. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.awesomebend.org\">Awesome Bend<\/a> is now accepting applications for proposals that will make Bend an even better\u00a0place to live, work or play for its next quarterly grant.<\/p>\n<p>The application\u00a0deadline is January 1, 2016.
