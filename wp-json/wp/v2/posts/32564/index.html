The professionally managed early-venture fund is hosting a &#8220;Pitch for a Beer&#8221; event Monday, June 22, inviting Central Oregon entrepreneurs to pitch their startup to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.portlandseedfund.com\/\">Portland Seed Fund<\/a> alumni, fund managers and mentors.<\/p>\n<p>Each founder will have two minutes to sell their idea. No slides, presentations or handouts are allowed. The evening will also include a chance to hear from companies who have been through PSF&#8217;s 90-day, non-resident, mentor-led accelerator program. (<a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50startups-prestobox-first-to-automate-branding-process\/\">Prestobox<\/a>, one of our #50startups, is an alum).<\/p>\n<p>Jenn Lynch, PSF venture partner, told BendTECH that the fund is traveling the state looking to meet great Oregon companies outside of Portland.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Traditionally, who you know is a big part of getting a meeting with an <span class=\"il\">investment<\/span> <span class=\"il\">fund<\/span>. We\u2019re looking for companies outside this tight network \u2013 great entrepreneurs who\u2019ve been bootstrapping their business and who are ready and able to take it to the next level. We\u2019ve got a hunch that we need to get outside our network \u2013 both metaphorically and physically \u2013 to find those entrepreneurs.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The PSF has made 58 seed and early-stage investments. The event will be held at the 1001 Tech Center. It&#8217;s open only to entrepreneurs who want to pitch &#8212; there&#8217;s no audience or spectators. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/portland-seed-fund-pitch-for-a-beer-bend-tickets-17248480670\">You can find registration and more information here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Portland Seed Fund is taking its show on the road &#8212; and the first stop is Bend.
