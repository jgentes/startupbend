While there, Dumas ran an instant whurk poll for Harrison, asking the startup&#8217;s network of thousands of college students if they knew the song Burning Down the House (they did).<\/p>\n<p>The meeting spurred new ideas about how whurk could help promote bands and music. And in fact, because the world is small, Harrison introduced Dumas to members of the band Live* (hang there for three minutes while I sing Lightning Crashes), who now have a company that produces various artists.\u00a0So whurk is going to help distribute flash drives with music from their bands to campus radio stations, as well as promote band merchandise.<\/p>\n<p>In related news, Dumas says whurk is nearing profitability and may consider another round of funding. See? Isn&#8217;t your Friday that much better now?<\/p>\n<p>* <em>Some people may have snuck out of the house in high school to see a Live concert. Those people were subsequently grounded until Thanksgiving, but they think it was still worth it.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What could make your Friday even better?
