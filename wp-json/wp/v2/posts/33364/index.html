One of them is Jim Schell, a long time advocate for entrepreneurship in Bend and Oregon. In the following guest blog post, Jim provides a &#8216;state of the union&#8217; for our local ecosystem.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In the year 2000 the State of Oregon hired me to start nine \u201cpeer advisory board\u201d organizations for small business owners in various communities around our state. Over the course of the following two years I coaxed 60,000 miles out of my trusty Jeep, met a lot of interesting folks, and did what I was hired to do. (Check out\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.opp-knocks.org\/\">Opportunity Knocks<\/a>\u00a0to understand the Bend-based organization that I was asked to replicate.)<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33382\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33382\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33382\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Jim-Schell-200x250.png\" alt=\"Jim Schell\" width=\"200\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33382\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jim Schell<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>I quickly learned that there were varying degrees of entrepreneurial ecosystem development within those communities, ranging from minimal in some to none in others. Here in Bend, for instance, our entrepreneurial ecosystem was pretty much non-existent in 2000, today it is advanced. (I think so anyway, though I could be a tad biased.) As a result, we have spawned literally hundreds of vibrant entrepreneurial businesses in tech, bio-science, outdoor, food, micro-brewery and UAV industries.<\/p>\n<p>I started thinking about what we\u2019ve done here in Bend and wondering what the rest of the state is doing to be more friendly to business owners and especially to \u00a0entrepreneurs who are building the kind of businesses that create jobs.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33175\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33175\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33175\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CrowdIMG_4725-250x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Lots of entrepreneurial activity at the 1001.  \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33175\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lots of entrepreneurial activity at the 1001.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>From my time spent in those communities I know that some of them have the necessary enthusiasm and passion to develop a successful ecosystem; I have learned however, that a \u201cbias to action\u201d culture is what is usually missing when a community\u2019s infrastructure fails to keep up with its needs. (Since \u201cbias to action\u201d is a key entrepreneurial ingredient, it\u2019s no surprise that this trait transfers into the developing of a vibrant entrepreneurial-friendly culture.)<\/p>\n<p>In order to explain what we\u2019ve done in Bend, we must first define the phrase \u201centrepreneurial ecosystem.\u201d There are really two parts to Bend\u2019s ecosystem. The first part is the ecosystem that includes our \u201cTraditional Business\u201d sector; \u00a0those mature community businesses that created and developed here in the 90s and earlier. These include Bend\u2019s developers, auto dealers, attorneys, CPAs, retail merchants and utility businesses. The service providers that support this Traditional Ecosystem include the Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business Development Center, the Rotary Clubs, Opportunity Knocks, the Economic Development folks, and the City of Bend\u2019s Economic Development Advisory Board.<\/p>\n<p>The second part is the ecosystem that includes what we call our \u201cNew Economy\u201d business sector. These are those businesses whose customers are located somewhere other than Bend; in economic development jargon they\u2019re known as \u201ctraded-sector\u201d businesses. For example, the tech, bio-science, outdoor, and micro-brewery businesses in Bend are burgeoning New Economy industries.<\/p>\n<p>In the past 15 years, Bend has significantly enhanced its entrepreneurial ecosystem to support this New Economy. Additions to our ecosystem &#8212; none which existed in 2000, with the exception of Opportunity Knocks &#8212; include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/bendvc.edcoinfo.com\/\">Bend Venture Conference:<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0The largest angel conference in Oregon and the Pacific NW.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cascadeangels.com\/\">Cascade Angels<\/a>:<\/strong>\u00a0An organized and active alliance of angel investors.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/sevenpeaksventures.com\/\">Seven Peaks Ventures<\/a>:<\/strong>\u00a0Bend\u2019s home-based venture fund.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stable of Experts:<\/strong>\u00a0125 current and past business experts offering free advice.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bend Venture Catalyst:<\/strong>\u00a0An EDCO position that supports and fosters our new economy ecosystem.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/edcoinfo.com\/event\/\">EDCO PubTalks<\/a>:<\/strong>\u00a0A monthly community-wide meetup that includes a keynote speaker, funding pitches, and super-serious networking, to oftentimes a SRO crowd of 300.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/opp-knocks.org\/\">Opportunity Knocks (OK)<\/a>:<\/strong>\u00a0OK features 20 teams of \u201cPeer Advisory Board\u201d members assisting 175 business owners &amp; entrepreneurs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Industry Coordinator:<\/strong>\u00a0A funded position to helps organize and coordinate the New Economy businesses in four of Bend\u2019s emerging active business clusters; Tech, Bio-Science, Outdoor and Specialty Food Products.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.techallianceco.org\/\">Tech Alliance of Central Oregon<\/a>:<\/strong>\u00a0A Bend-based organization formed to serve the region\u2019s Bend\u2019s tech entrepreneurs.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonoutdooralliance.org\/\">Oregon Outdoor Alliance<\/a>:<\/strong>\u00a0An organization formed to serve Bend\u2019s outdoor-industry businesses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And that\u2019s not all.

In Bend the catalyst was our super-active Economic Development of Central Oregon organization (EDCO, a 501 (c) 6), which in turn flourished because it had visionary management and a high level of community-wide support; support which came from local citizens, businesses and governments getting behind the ecosystem-development concept.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31628\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-31628\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BVC2014-Volcano-Veggies-Winner-Shot_web-250x250.gif\" alt=\"Jim and Shannon Sbarra. co-founders of Volcano Veggies, showing off their giant checks from 2014 BVC.

Photo by Marissa Chappell Hossick.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cGetting behind\u201d, in this case, can be defined as volunteering time and writing fat checks. EDCO also has an entrepreneurial culture itself; a culture that allows them to launch new support organizations, but, at the same time, maintain their autonomy, as evidenced by a lack of need to control what they create.<\/p>\n<p>In your community it could be an independent (non-government) economic development organization like EDCO, it could be a group of current or retired entrepreneurs who are looking for an opportunity to get their juices flowing again or it could be an organic group of citizens who simply want to better their community by enhancing their business ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Or, it could be one visionary zealot, someone who is moved to make a difference and has a large dose of bias-to-action energy in his or her DNA. (In Bend, that person was EDCO Director Roger Lee).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem in your own community, one of Bend\u2019s local entrepreneurs (and co-founder of this very blog) James Gentes, has created an online template to help his clients replicate some of what Bend has done.
