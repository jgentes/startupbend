He raised five separate rounds of venture capital and ultimately sold the company to Boeing for more than $400 million in 2008. So he knows a thing or two about successful startups. Sliwa will talk about the lessons he learned in building Institu and how he turned the company&#8217;s location in Bingen, a tiny town on the Washington side of the Columbia River, from a challenge to an advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Sliwa is now head of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seeq.com\/\">Seeq<\/a>, a Seattle-based startup that is developing software to help manufacturing companies analyze their industrial process data. Sliwa will talk more about this new venture as well.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendvc.com\/\">BVC<\/a> will take place on Oct. 17th at the Tower Theater in Bend. The annual event, which is Oregon&#8217;s largest angel conference, is divided into two categories. There&#8217;s five launch stage and five concept stage companies that are each vying for investment and cash prizes. The latter compete for a $10,000 prize from BendBroadband. Meanwhile the launch stage finalists have the chance to win a $250,000 (or larger) investment.<\/p>\n<p>The competing companies present on stage. They&#8217;re judged by a panel of investors, entrepreneurs and VCs. The pitches themselves are interesting and give great insight into the creative endeavors happening here and around Oregon. But especially if you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or working with a startup, hearing the feedback the judges provide on the pitches and the questions they ask on stage is an invaluable part of the conference.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/2014-bend-venture-conference-tickets-12049084135\">Tickets are on sale now.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Sliwa, former CEO of Institu and current CEO of Seeq, will be the keynote speaker at this year&#8217;s Bend Venture Conference.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16,12,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/31272"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=31272"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/31272\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":31274,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/31272\/revisions\/31274"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=31272"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=31272"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=31272"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
