The vision? TAO STEAM wants to form a network of Central Oregon professionals committed to creating a path for girls and women interested in STEAM careers &#8212; and a gender balanced future.<\/p>\n<p>One of our favorite people, Maggie Hubbell, CEO of Agency Revolution and Chair of the Steering Committee says, \u201cIn the ideal world the term &#8216;women in STEAM&#8217; wouldn\u2019t exist. But, the reality is this issue does need special attention right now. We want to provide a supportive community that enriches the experience for women currently in STEAM careers and find ways to attract more women into these fields. Central Oregon has a lot of support around this issue and I believe if we work together we can really make a difference.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From the news release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>TAO STEAM\u2019s mission is to unify Central Oregon\u2019s women in the STEAM community with a vision of enabling Central Oregon\u2019s women to reach their full STEAM potential. Goals are to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create paths for girls and women interested in STEAM career<\/li>\n<li>Establish a platform for connections, resources and opportunities<\/li>\n<li>Enable ongoing education opportunities for career growth and prosperity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The group is inviting the community, businesses, non-profits, and individuals to collaborate and serve as a resource for learning, growth, and outreach, for both women and Central Oregon as a whole. TAO STEAM members will be invited to join and participate in small groups or communities, built around job functions and key areas in STEAM fields.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis network squares perfectly with the Central Oregon STEM Hub\u2019s vision for cultivating a regional STEM ecosystem. Our core partners promote opportunities and pathways to prepare students for a future driven by STEM; connecting with the community, non-profits, and industry is essential. It all fits together.\u201d said Whitney Swander, Executive Director, Central Oregon STEM Hub.<\/p>\n<p>Interested?
