Cascade Angels is Having a Ticket Giveaway!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Do you love contests? Do you love #winning? Do you really, really want to go to Bend Venture Conference? Then it might just be your lucky day.<\/p>\n<p>Our friends at <a href=\"http:\/\/cascadeangels.com\/\">Cascade Angels<\/a>, a regional angel fund located right here in Bend, have decided to give away one ticket to the upcoming Bend Venture Conference in the best possible way: With a little competition. Now IMHO, the best competitions tend to involve beer and running. But Cascade Angels wanted to do something a little more creative and potentially less injury inducing.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you play? It&#8217;s easy. Simply email me &#8212; kelly@startupbend.com &#8212; a very short explanation of why you should win this ticket. Keep it at 100 words or less. Get creative. Get real. And get going. Send your entry in <strong>by Tuesday, Sept. 19. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll gather them up and send them over to the Cascade Angels for review and the verdict. The winning winner receives:<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; 1 Ticket to BVC (value: $299)<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; 1 #julieselfie with Cascade Angels Fund Manager Julie Harrelson at the conference plus a post about them on this very blog.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212; A high-five from the entire staff of StartupBend. Get your hand ready, because that&#8217;s a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Time to bring your A-game friends. Excited to see what you got. Send it over.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26BGvkTon3hpPBswE\" width=\"480\" height=\"240\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/fallontonight-nbc-tonight-show-26BGvkTon3hpPBswE\">via GIPHY<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you love contests?
