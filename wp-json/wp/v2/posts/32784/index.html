The pair launched FoodFu, <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/like-chopped-bend-app-dev-company-debuts-foodfu-today\/\">an interactive cooking competition app at the end of July<\/a>. This week? Well, they&#8217;ll be pitching the app at Google as part of the Summer of Apps Eating &amp; Drinking contest.<\/p>\n<p>FoodFu is one of 10 finalists competing in the event, presented by <a href=\"http:\/\/appcircus.com\/\">Appcircus<\/a> and Google. FoodFu will have three minutes to pitch in front of a panel Friday. Those judges include\u00a0Nick Nappi from Season Six of FOX\u2019s \u201cMasterChef\u201d and Kathy Kam, representing the Google Cloud Platform.<\/p>\n<p>The panel will pick a winning app based on originality, technical feasibility, potential impact on the user, financial viability and design. The winner\u00a0will receive a direct slot to present at the Mobile Premier Awards (MPA) 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, including airfare and a top networking dinner after the event. And the MPA is a Big Deal: Previous MPA winners include Waze, Layar, and Swiftkey.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFoodFu was just released in the App Store a few weeks ago. This recognition from Appcircus so quickly after the launch is exciting,&#8221; says Jim Sipe. &#8220;It helps us to know that others are already seeing the potential of FoodFu as much as we do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Sipes co-founded Binary Star Systems, a Bend-based startup focused on creating apps that promote human interaction.
