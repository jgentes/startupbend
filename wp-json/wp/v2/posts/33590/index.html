It sounds simple, but it&#8217;s crucial to survival for a business whose largest subscription comes in at about $400\/month.<\/p>\n<p>Bob Lewis, co-founder of PulsedLight, which was recently acquired by Garmin, shared his decades of experience with startups including &#8220;a few of the million ways to die.&#8221; The latter included ceasing to innovate your technology, diluting your company&#8217;s IP over time until you have nothing of value and remaining so fixated on a business path that you can&#8217;t see the opportunities.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33593\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33593\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33593\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160224_202512-1-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Lewis, co-founder of PulsedLight, talking about startup challenges.\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160224_202512-1-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160224_202512-1-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bob Lewis, co-founder of PulsedLight, talking about startup challenges.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He also talked about his bootstrapped strategy for success including the value of using consulting gigs to pay the bills while your business gets off the ground. In true bootstrapped fashion, Lewis noted that at one point he sold his car to fund his startup. He also noted the importance of finding the right investment partners and of being patient and persistent.<\/p>\n<p>To the latter point: Lewis, and his co-founder Dennis Corey got real about the startup grind &#8212; the never-ending mountain of work, the discouraging moments &#8212; and how to deal. From the back of the room, Corey told the crowd that often it was a matter of breaking big goals into smaller tasks. Lewis noted that sometimes &#8220;you just had to get through the next week or even just the day.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The event was sponsored by <a href=\"https:\/\/bendbroadband.com\/business\/\">BendBroadband Business,<\/a>\u00a0who also provided awesome gifts for our presenters (lap top cases made from recycled fishing nets)\u00a0and hosted by <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/cowork\/\">BendTECH<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the1001bend.com\/\">the 1001 Tech Center<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Stackhousecoffee\/\">Stackhouse<\/a> stayed open late to serve drinks.
