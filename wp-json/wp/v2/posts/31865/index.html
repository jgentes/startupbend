The Cascade Angels Fund 2014 announced Monday that it invested even more into <a href=\"http:\/\/amplion.com\/\">Amplion Research<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/poachedjobs.com\/choose\/\">Poached Jobs<\/a>, the first and second place BVC winners respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Cascade Angels funded Bend-based Amplion with an additional $48,000 and Poached Jobs, based in Portland, with another $42,000. That brings the Fund\u2019s total investment in the two BVC winners to $211,900.<\/p>\n<p>This is the final investment for the Cascade Angels\u2019 2014 fund, which had a busy inaugural year. The fund, headquartered here, also invested in two other Bend-based companies &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.manzama.com\/\">Manzama<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/droplr.com\/\">Droplr<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a major investor in the BVC Fund this year, we were pleased to have such great investment candidates to review,\u201d said Julie Harrelson, manager of the Cascade Angels Fund and CEO of the Harrelson Group via the EDCO news release.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe additional $90,000 investment &#8230; is a testament to the high quality standard that the BVC is setting, accelerating our efforts to fill in the gap of much needed local patient capital. We are currently in the process of building the 2015 Fund,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The BVC proved a boon for Amplion: Including the most recent investment from Cascade Angels, the bioresearch startup won $448,000. Poached Jobs, a hiring platform for the restaurant industry, garnered a total of $142,000.<\/p>\n<p>The last cash infusion brings the total investment for BVC to $1,063,300. That chunk of change, according to EDCO, set a record for the most cash, investment and prizes awarded at an angel conference in the Pacific Northwest.<\/p>\n<p>Brian Vierra, EDCO\u2019s Venture Catalyst, is already looking forward to 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe BVC and Cascade Angels Funds completed their final due diligence, negotiation, legal review, and funding within approximately 60 days,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are already hard at work planning next year\u2019s BVC and will continue to build a strong entrepreneurial community through these efforts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Here is a break-down of the $1,063,300 tally:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BVC LLC Fund Angels: $148,400<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cascade Angels Fund: $211,900<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seven Peaks Ventures: $350,000<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oregon Growth Account: $50,000<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oregon Community Foundation: $25,000<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Craft3: $26,500<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mandala Fire Starter Marketing Program: 2 Awards totaling $65,000<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BendBroadband concept stage cash prize: $10,000<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Palo Alto Live Plan: $1,500<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Additional side investments: commitments currently at $175,000<\/p>\n<p><em>* You don&#8217;t remember?!
