Gray described the round as a bridge between Droplr&#8217;s initial seed round (which was about $850,000) and a potential Series A.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re planning to grow our team from 10 to 15, and do more outbound sales to the thousands of companies we haven&#8217;t gone after before,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>This recent round was lead by Bend-based Cascade Angels, who invested another $150,000 in the startup. Inspiration Ventures, out of Burlingame, Calif., invested $100,000. Seven Peaks Ventures, also from Bend, and a group of individuals from Nashville filled out the rest.<\/p>\n<p>The company makes sharing screen shots and files easier. Earlier this year, t<a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/hey-slackers-droplr-debuts-screenbot-app-for-slack\/\">he startup announced an integration with Slack<\/a> to do just that. Most recently, Gray says the startup has forged a partnership with Cisco. Droplr is building an integration for Cisco&#8217;s own communication platform, Spark, and then looking to pursue channel sales via relationships with Cisco&#8217;s enterprise clients.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;(Cisco&#8217;s) clients have the same needs as many of the teams we already serve, but they&#8217;re a hundred times bigger,&#8221; Gray says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity for for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Other news from Droplr: They recently moved offices, and are now located across the street from the 1001 Tech Center. And the company hired a vp of sales, Chris Scotch, who brings 12 years of enterprise sales and startup experience.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34031\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34031\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34031 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unnamed-500x377.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\" data-wp-pid=\"34031\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unnamed-500x377.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unnamed-768x580.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unnamed-1024x773.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unnamed-800x604.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34031\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Part of the Droplr team at Tumalo Falls: Nicole Pressprich; Levi Nunnink; Harrison Sanford; Nick Bernard and Gray Skinner.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Droplr recently raised another $400,000 to grow its team and accelerate its outbound sales efforts, says Gray Skinner, the Bend [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":34031,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[12,15,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34030"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34030"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34030\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":34033,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34030\/revisions\/34033"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34031"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34030"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34030"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=34030"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
