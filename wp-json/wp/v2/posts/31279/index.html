Last May Johnson-Stempson helped organize the Microsoft Women&#8217;s Hackathon, which drew more than 2,000 participants from around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>In a<a href=\"http:\/\/www.edtechmagazine.com\/k12\/article\/2014\/08\/decoding-gender-gap-computer-science\"> recent interview with EdTech<\/a>, Johnson-Stempson said that while a longstanding gender bias has deprived girls the opportunity to learn about technology, there&#8217;s change in the air.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We need to show the impact computer science has in changing the world and solving its greatest challenges \u2014 HIV, cancer, global warming, etc. \u2014 and we need to discuss how it is creative, collaborative, and each day is different,\u201d Johnson-Stempson says. \u201cComputer science is no longer one person sitting behind a computer programming by themselves. It requires teams with different skill sets asking questions differently to solve a problem. This is what excites girls.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>She then provided eight tips aimed at piquing the interest of girls in computer programming:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Give girls more opportunities to build \u2014 not just consume \u2014 digital resources such as blogs, websites, apps, comics, podcasts and videos.<\/li>\n<li>Encourage girls to try programming with tools like Microsoft\u2019sTouchDevelop, Kodu, Scratch, App Maker and others:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/diversity%20and http:\/\/code.org\">http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/diversity\u00a0and\u00a0http:\/\/code.org<\/a><\/li>\n<li>When you have a technical issue, ask your daughter or student if she knows how to fix it; if she doesn&#8217;t,figure it out together.<\/li>\n<li>Play games.<\/li>\n<li>Share the story of history\u2019s first programmer, Ada Lovelace.<\/li>\n<li>Arrange for your daughter or student to shadow women working in technology.<\/li>\n<li>Have her watch these videos on women researchers who are making a difference:\u00a0<a title=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/collaboration\/focus\/womenincomputing\/profiles.aspx\" href=\"http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/collaboration\/focus\/womenincomputing\/\">http:\/\/research.microsoft.com\/en-us\/collaboration\/focus\/womenincomputing.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Send her to a computer programming camp.
