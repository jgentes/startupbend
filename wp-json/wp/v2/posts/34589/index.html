That was in 2010. People loved the solution, and began signing up. \u201cIt\u2019s really for any business that lives and dies by their appointment book,\u201d Frank says.<\/p>\n<p>By 2014, Apptoto was making enough money that Frank quit his job at Yahoo to go full-time with his own startup. Frank\u2019s bootstrapped business was \u2013 and is \u2013 making money, with a robust roster of clients that includes healthcare offices, law firms, financial advisors and more.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34591\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34591\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34591\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/toto_apptoto-500x273.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/toto_apptoto-500x273.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/toto_apptoto-768x419.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/toto_apptoto-1024x559.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/toto_apptoto.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34591\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Please send us this dog.\u00a0<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Coming home<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Frank and his wife moved to Central Oregon last July. \u201cNow that we have kids we wanted more of a family lifestyle and we were excited to come back,\u201d he says. Apptoto opened an office in Bend shortly after, and are headed for a new space above Silverado in downtown next month.<\/p>\n<p>The three-employee company continues to grow. While the appointment reminder space is fairly crowded, Frank says that Apptoto has gained a loyal following because the product connects to whatever calendar system that businesses are using. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to switch systems, Apptoto just works in the background,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-34592\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/apptoto-ex-1024x762.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/apptoto-ex-1024x762.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/apptoto-ex-500x372.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/apptoto-ex-768x572.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/apptoto-ex.jpeg 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The company is now hiring for three positions: <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/jobs\/view\/software-engineer-8\/\">a software engineer<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/jobs\/view\/sales-engineer\/\">a sales engineer<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/jobs\/view\/uiux-designer\/\">UI\/UX designer<\/a>.
