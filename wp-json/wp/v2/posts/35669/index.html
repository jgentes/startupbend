Cascade Angels Sponsors &#8220;3 Qs to Win&#8221; Ticket Giveaway via Startup Bend! Go for it!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The third week of October may seem far enough away \u2013 especially as we\u2019re still wearing flip flops and remembering the fun of summer. But such is the nature of time, it keeps on moving and here we are thinking about Bend Venture Conference.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cascadeangels.com\">Cascade Angels<\/a> has graciously decided to host another BVC ticket giveaway this year via the Startup Bend blog. Last year\u2019s contest generated a host of awesome entries and provided additional access to the conference for people that really wanted to be there.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe BVC is a unique event in a unique place; it\u2019s a great entry point for entrepreneurs, investors and others interested in getting involved in Bend\u2019s startup community,\u201d Cascade Angels Co-Fund Manager Robert Pease says. \u201cWe see the ticket giveaway as a way to facilitate more connections, and give another person the opportunity to understand more of what\u2019s happening here and all the entrepreneurial resources available.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a chance to ask some cool people some fun questions. Which brings me to how this contest is going to work. Here is the plan:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide brief (50 words or less) answers to the three questions below. Remember there are no right answers. Be real. Be creative. Be yourself. The questions are:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><strong>Why should you win a ticket to the BVC?<\/strong><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>How\/why did you become interested in Bend?<\/strong><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>What was your very first job?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Email your answers to <a href=\"mailto:Kelly@startupbend.com\">Kelly@startupbend.com<\/a> by <b><b>Sept. 24.<\/b><\/b><\/li>\n<li>The Cascade Angels team will review and we\u2019ll announce the winner that week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your prize \u2013 as mentioned \u2013 is a free ticket to the Bend Venture Conference, courtesy of Cascade Angels. What\u2019s that mean? Well, first off you save $329, which is how much BVC tickets cost. Second, you get access to the seminars, the Social Impact conference, the Thursday night networking event and the entire conference Friday. It\u2019s an inspiring, action-packed, fun-filled two days that will leave you flush with new contacts, new ideas and \u2013 IMHO \u2013 a good appreciation for how our little corner of the world aims to support and grow ideas, founders and companies. It&#8217;s good stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Questions? Just ask. Otherwise, send me some answers! Can&#8217;t wait to hear from you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are few gifs to get you inspired &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/XIqCQx02E1U9W\" width=\"480\" height=\"269\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This is you, just getting after those 50-word answers.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/XIqCQx02E1U9W\">via GIPHY<\/a><\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Fc6pf86FKCeA\" width=\"480\" height=\"258\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This is how excited the contest winners are.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/win-winner-winning-Fc6pf86FKCeA\">via GIPHY<\/a><\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/6y5Mt3sPqOx1kHCMkO\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/halfthepicture-women-6y5Mt3sPqOx1kHCMkO\">via GIPHY<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I mean not to overstate it, but &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The third week of October may seem far enough away \u2013 especially as we\u2019re still wearing flip flops and remembering [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":31195,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35669"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=35669"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35669\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":35671,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35669\/revisions\/35671"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/31195"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=35669"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=35669"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=35669"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
