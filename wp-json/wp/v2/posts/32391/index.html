Then he could pop it open and fill it up before boarding. But even after diving deep into the depths of Amazon (there\u2019s things you can\u2019t unsee people) Singlaub couldn\u2019t find what he needed. So being a product designer by trade and an entrepreneur at heart, he made one.<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, Singlaub was onto something. His collapsible water bottle not only caught the attention of his friends and family, but he\u2019s raised nearly $100,000 thanks to excited Kickstarter backers this month. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/291569621\/hydawaytm-a-pocket-sized-water-bottle-fit-for-any\">And the campaign is still going<\/a>. BendTECH sat down with Singlaub to discuss what goes into designing his collapsible water bottle called the Hydaway, and how he transformed his idea into a successful, nearing six-figure Kickstarter campaign.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup:<\/strong> Hydaway<br \/>\n<strong>Founded:<\/strong> June 2014<br \/>\n<strong>Founder:<\/strong> Niki Singlaub<br \/>\n<strong>Location:<\/strong> Bend<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s wrong with regular water bottles? <\/strong>Well, my complaint actually came from travelling. I was taking all these short flights for work and just bringing a carry-on. I couldn\u2019t find a water bottle that fit into my messenger bag. I really wanted something I could collapse and put into my pocket, but all I could find online were those bladders.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32393\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32393\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/niki-bigger.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-32393 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/niki-bigger.jpg\" alt=\"niki bigger\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32393\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Niki Singlaub, founder of Hydaway.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>So you made one? <\/strong>Yep. I\u2019m a product designer. I do freelance product design and product management for a range of outdoor gear, kid and pet product companies. After I had this idea, I went to REI and found two collapsible camp cups and glued them together. Then I used a desk grommet as a lid. That was my proof of concept.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway_niki_large.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-31308\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway_niki_large-500x332.jpg\" alt=\"hydaway_niki_large\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway_niki_large-500x332.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway_niki_large.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What did it take to transform two, glued camp cups into a product that you could actually use? <\/strong>It was a long process, probably about two years. After I had that first prototype, I showed my family and friends and they couldn\u2019t believe something like it didn\u2019t already exist. I started to refine the idea, sketching out the designs and hiring a firm to help create computer models. Then I found a 3-D printer that could print a silicone-like plastic and we made a sample. During this time I also ran a couple of IP searches to make sure no one else was working on the same idea.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was your biggest concern? <\/strong>I really wanted to make sure the product was watertight. I mean we were focused on it being collapsible, but if it couldn\u2019t hold water, what\u2019s the point? We really had to laser in on the details such as the seal between the straw and lid, and the thickness of the material.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32394\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32394\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-32394 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway-pic-500x330.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway-pic-500x330.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hydaway-pic.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32394\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fold up your water bottle.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Your Kickstarter campaign is still going strong. Were you surprised by its success? What do you think caused it? <\/strong>\u00a0I was a little surprised. I had done a Kickstarter campaign last summer. I\u2019d set a goal of $40,000 and raised $23,000. So technically it failed, but I got 350 backers out of it. That first time I just set up the campaign and hit go, and then starting contacting media and other supporters. This time around I started reaching out to those original backers months beforehand, and really getting people excited about early bird rewards for the first supporters. When we finally launched on April 12, people were ready. We reached our funding goal in 27 hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And you got the attention of Kickstarter too? <\/strong>Yes, because we had such a large amount of early support, we were listed as one of the most popular campaigns for the first few days and then we became a Kickstarter Staff Pick. We had a lot of momentum. I realized that it was a lot more about selling the rewards and the product than fundraising. I feel like that first campaign really helped us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will you do with the money? <\/strong>Since we funded so early, I was able to place a purchase order with my manufacturer in China right away. We\u2019ll fill our Kickstarter order first and that should be done by August. Then I\u2019ve been talking with many retailers including REI, Amazon, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and local outdoor, kids, and gift shops. I\u2019ll use the rest of the funds to fill retail orders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you anticipate Hydaway becoming your full-time job? <\/strong>I\u2019ll definitely be busy this summer. Then after these first orders, I\u2019ll need to evaluate what to do. There\u2019s a whole beverage container industry here in Central Oregon with Hydroflask and Silipint. I hope Hydaway could be a company like that. I already have a whole product line sketched out that includes things like collapsible luggage and lunch boxes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Niki Singlaub travels a lot for work and wanted a water bottle that folded to fit into his pocket while [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":32394,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[61,13,14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32391"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32391"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32391\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32396,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32391\/revisions\/32396"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/32394"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32391"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32391"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32391"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
