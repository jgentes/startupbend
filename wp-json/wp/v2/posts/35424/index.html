Who wants news soup? Sorry no soup for you. Just kidding. Spend a few minutes getting caught up and penciling things into your calendar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Want to reinvent CS education? OSU Cascades is hiring<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do you love to code? And love to teach? OSU Cascades is hiring two new CS instructors. It&#8217;s an opportunity to help reinvent CS education at OSU Cascades, and generate positive community impact. Yong Bakos, CS instructor, reports that the school &#8220;continues to collaborate with and facilitate K12 education, working with the school district, individual schools, teachers and students. Our CS undergraduates are out there volunteering and mentoring after school coding classes, and at events like ChickTECH. We continue to build positive relationships between students and local businesses. We have the opportunity to innovate by reinventing the computer science experience in higher ed. We work on open source projects related to ecology, river restoration, and other local concerns.&#8221; If that sounds like everything you love,<a href=\"https:\/\/jobs.oregonstate.edu\/postings\/56697\"> then take a chance and apply<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cascade Angels opens funding for early stage startups<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nEntrepreneurs seeking investment capital have an opportunity to present their early stage businesses to Bend-based\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cascadeangels.com\">Cascade Angels<\/a>.

Join the newly formed BendTECH running club<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The BendTECH coworking space has launched a running club. This informal group of delightful, very not hardcore running people meets Tuesdays at 12:30 p.m. at BendTECH at 1001 SW Emkay. Everyone is invited&#8211;you don&#8217;t need to be a coworking member. The pace is a reasonable 9 to 10+ min miles and the group is running three to five miles each time. It&#8217;s a great way to meet people in the community, get some exercise and explore some trails. If you have questions, email coworking@bendtech.com. Sometimes Taco Tuesday happens at BendTECH right after, which is like running club but without the running and instead people eat tacos.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VP of Ops for Customer.io and former Agency Revolution CEO keynotes Thursday PubTalk<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Thursday&#8217;s EDCO PubTalk features one of our favorite people and business leaders in the world.

But ICYMI, I also enjoyed learning more about the role that exercise plays in Gray&#8217;s work and life <a href=\"http:\/\/www.austinfitmagazine.com\/March-2018\/How-High-Intensity-Exercise-Makes-Me-a-Better-CEO\/#.WpgWopKDLW4.twitter\">via this piece in AustinFit Magazine<\/a>. Gray is an elite triathlete and cyclist. He has some great insights into how exercise relates to high-performance in his career. &#8220;Proving to myself that I can persevere and break through in training creates strength and confidence that I can do the same at work,&#8221; he says.

You probably read the piece, but I wanted to share a second take on the issue from Seven Peak&#8217;s Matt Abrams. Matt, a native Oregonian, dug a bit deeper into what&#8217;s happening here in Bend and offered some additional perspective. &#8220;Keeping Bend\u00a0<em>Bend<\/em>\u00a0is what drives me and and my partners every single day. We aren\u2019t trying to build another Silicon Valley or simply become its bedroom community,&#8221; he notes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/back-againbend-oregon-matt-abrams\/\">Take a few minutes to read Matt&#8217;s thoughts about what&#8217;s happening in our startup and tech community<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all the news soup we have for now.
