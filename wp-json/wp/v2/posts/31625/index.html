We sell our produce through a CSA-style program to individuals and we also just starting providing restaurants and a few grocery stores with our greens. You can find us at Newport Market and C.E. Lovejoys.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what is aquaponics?<\/strong> It\u2019s a system for producing food that combines aquaculture with hydroponics. However, there\u2019s a couple big differences between what we do and hydroponics. The main one is that we embrace good bacteria and they help us out. Our garden module has the plants growing up top, and there\u2019s Tilapia in the tank below. The fish waste settles on the bottom and we collect it in barrels. Bacteria then helps break down the ammonia into nitrates, and we sprinkle that nitrate-rich water on our plants. We use 98% less water than traditional farming. We use grow lights and some natural light as well. We don\u2019t use any pesticides, and in fact, we can\u2019t even use tap water because it\u2019s bad for the fish. With this system, you\u2019re really getting the best, most purely organic produce out there.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31629\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31629\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141103-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31629\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141103-1-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Lettuce growing on the walls of the garden module Jim Sbarra designed. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141103-1-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141103-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31629\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lettuce growing on the walls of the garden module Jim Sbarra designed.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>What are you growing? <\/strong>Right now it\u2019s mostly mixed lettuces and some herbs such as basil. We\u2019re getting ready to add strawberries. Eventually we\u2019ll sell the fish too, but we need to get a permit from the city to do that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspired the idea? <\/strong>Shannon and I met in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and while we were living there my mom was diagnosed with cancer. We went to help her. She was really worried about the chemotherapy and the effect it would have on her body. She did a lot of research and discovered a lot of people who were having success in battling disease using nutrition and a plant-based diet. So she changed how she was eating and we did too. She ended up doing just one month of chemo. But we all felt so great while we were eating all these greens that the diet stuck. When we came back to Jackson we realized how hard it was to get greens most of the year, and how far our food had to travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you have experience farming? <\/strong>I\u2019m actually a designer by trade. In fact, Shannon and I have a marketing\/design business called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skyfirestudio.com\/\">Skyfire Studio<\/a>. We wanted to make a change because we were burned out from being in front of computers all the time. I began studying aquaponics and learned more about it during some time we spent in Hawaii. The last 18 months have basically been R&amp;D to get our first module up and running.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest thing about learning to farm indoors? <\/strong>So far it\u2019s been figuring out the grow lights. A lot of them are made for hobbyists, and we\u2019re trying to take that to an industrial level. We\u2019ve had some great help from a Sisters-based company called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smartgrowtechnologies.com\/\">Smart Grow Technologies<\/a>. It\u2019s also stressful when you\u2019re dealing with live inventory: you can kill it or it can go bad. Everything has to be just right.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31630\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31630\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141246.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31630\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141246-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Natural light coming in through the ceiling supplements the grow lamps. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141246-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141246-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141013_141246-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natural light coming in through the ceiling supplements the grow lamps.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How have customers responded? <\/strong>It\u2019s been overwhelming. We started as a CSA and now we\u2019re selling to grocery stores and restaurants. Newport Market tripled their order on the spot after selling out of our salad greens the first day. We\u2019d like to do more with restaurants, but we need to be able to produce more. We\u2019re currently harvesting about 60 pounds per week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you funded? <\/strong>We have been self-funded up until recently. We just had two investors sign on, and we\u2019d be open to more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next? <\/strong>We\u2019d like to build out several more modules. We have one now and with the BVC award we\u2019ve already started on the second. Ultimately we\u2019d like to expand into other ski towns and create modules that other people can buy and use themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next week in #50startups &#8230;\u00a0<\/strong>We&#8217;ll introduce you Agency Revolution, a Bend-based SaaS company that provides marketing automation software for insurance agents and brokers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s been a wild week for the folks at Volcano Veggies, an indoor aquaponic farming operation in Bend.
