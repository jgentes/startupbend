The La Pine resident was inspired to create portable energy bars for our furry friends after a backcountry ski trip with her own dog Dunkan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31895\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31895\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TurboPup.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31895\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TurboPup-500x333.jpg\" alt=\"Kristina Guerrero, founder of TurboPUP, on the set of SharkTank.

For instance, I love the entrepreneurs and hearing the ideas, but dislike how much everyone cries. Guerrero couldn&#8217;t say much about the upcoming episode, but as a decorated U.S. Air Force veteran and recipient of two combat air medals, she was well equipped for the intensity of the Tank.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #606569;\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through basic training that simulates being a POW,&#8221; she said in a phone call earlier this week. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t cry. But I will say\u00a0that it&#8217;s brutal honesty, it&#8217;s absolutely unfiltered brutal honesty. Everything that was said was valid, and it was really insightful feedback.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #606569;\">In the meantime, she&#8217;s been readying her website to accommodate an expected influx of buyers after the show. So tune into to ABC at 9 p.m. PT Friday to see what happened. And no matter the result, congrats to Guerrero. We&#8217;re excited to see what the future holds for TurboPUP!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kristina Guerrero, founder of TurboPUP, will debut her complete meal bars for dogs on Friday&#8217;s episode of Shark Tank.
