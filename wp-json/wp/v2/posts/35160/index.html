The three-woman team wanted to reinvent ketchup into something different.\u00a0 They launched in 2013 with three unique ketchups&#8211;curry, smoky and spicy. Back to the Central Oregon connection: One of the founders is Karen Bonner, a Bendite, BendTECH member and an advisory board member of the Central Oregon Food Cluster.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35161\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35161\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35161\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/taco-sauce-500x332.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/taco-sauce-500x332.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/taco-sauce.jpg 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35161\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">What you taco&#8217;n about?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Speaking of that, the food cluster is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/central-oregon-food-cluster-fb-meet-and-greet-tickets-39364272599\">hosting a meet and greet this Monday at Buzztag Swag Agency<\/a>.

Red Duck condiments are in 2,300 grocery stores around the country. In addition to ketchup, the company sells cocktail and barbecue sauce and&#8211;as you can surmise from the Kickstarter&#8211;coming soon, taco sauce.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of their crowdfunding pitch:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When we launched our organic condiment company as graduate students at the University of Oregon, we asked you: When was the last time YOU were excited about ketchup? Three-plus years as a successful food startup later, we&#8217;re launching something new \u2014 but we don&#8217;t think we need to ask you whether you&#8217;re excited about tacos.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve created a new line of Taco Sauces, using the same approach that caught your attention: real, organic ingredients, bringing unique and surprising twists to familiar favorites.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And the fact is, everyone does seem deeply excited about tacos lately. Check out the campaign and if you&#8217;re ever at BendTECH, say hello to Karen. She&#8217;s the one with ketchup bottles on her desk<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Eleven out of 10 people agree that hot sauce typically makes everything better.
