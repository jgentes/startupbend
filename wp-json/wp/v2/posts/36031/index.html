CEO Austin Anderson, previously a lead software engineer at LinkedIn, founded the company in late 2017 as a way to help small to mid-sized game studios find and engage developer talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re creating a better way for studios and top industry creators to find and work with one another,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cStudios often still rely on their existing channels to find truly usable, vetted talent while creators still struggle to find new gigs and manage existing ones. Rupie is here to bridge this gap.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_austin-anderson.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36033\" width=\"226\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_austin-anderson.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_austin-anderson-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_austin-anderson-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_austin-anderson-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" \/><figcaption>Austin Anderson, Rupie CEO<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rupie designed its platform from the ground up to flex to the needs of studios of all sizes. It currently comprises tools that allows studios to match projects to the right talent, oversee live projects transparently, and garner expert feedback to drive development forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, Rupie has garnered support and $500,000 in funding from former Twitch, Guitar Hero, and Riot executives as part of its still-open pre-seed round. The founding team includes, in addition to Anderson, Lead UI Engineer Lisa Manresa, Director of UX David Panzarella, and Director of BD Jonathan Tzou.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_lisa-manresa.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36034\" width=\"227\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_lisa-manresa.jpg 275w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_lisa-manresa-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\" \/><figcaption>Lisa Manresa, Lead UI Engineer<br><br><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_david-panzarella.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36035\" width=\"223\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_david-panzarella.jpg 275w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team_david-panzarella-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" \/><figcaption>David Panzarella, Director of UX<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe founder&#8217;s office comes at an opportune time,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cWith backing from experienced game industry vets and a strong initial response to our alpha release in January, we look forward to working more closely with local game studios and investors who want to be part of this exciting journey.\u201d<br><br>BendTECH offers the SFO office to selected founders in three-month rotations.
