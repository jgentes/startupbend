So much so, that the Cascade Angels team decided to give away TWO tickets instead of one. Which brings us to our winners.

It taught me a lot about how I want to build my business, what I&#8217;m looking for in funding and how I want to grow and move Mandala forward. I want to win this ticket because I want to see the magic that is BVC, what it takes to get there and the check out the incredible businesses that made it in.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>How\/why did you become interested in Bend?\u00a0<\/strong>Well, my interest in Bend wasn&#8217;t really my choice. I was born and raised here. However, my commitment to it, my desire to be here, that is all my own. As I continue to grow and thrive in this city, it continues to amaze me. The creativity, the opportunity and, most importantly, the community. I don&#8217;t have much experience in other cities, but I can&#8217;t imagine a city with more people willing to help you make your dream come true. Bend steps up when it comes to connecting people and creating a place where we feel comfortable sharing our ideas.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>What was your very first job?<\/strong> My very very first job was at Cibelli&#8217;s in Redmond (I tore up the pizza scene), but my first big kid job was at Five Talent. Five Talent is where I learned the direction I wanted to go with my career. Preston gave me an opportunity based on nothing but college experience and I am so grateful that I was able to work with that team to kickstart my career and grow into who I am today.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And here are Karen&#8217;s answers &#8230;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>Why should you win a ticket to the BVC?<\/strong>\u00a0I should win a ticket to the BVC because it&#8217;s an opportunity to make amazing connections that could contribute to the success of my business, Red Duck Foods!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>How\/why did you become interested in Bend?\u00a0<\/strong>Growing up on the other side of the mountains, I originally saw Bend as a fun place to visit. But after launching our own companies and hearing about the thriving entrepreneurial community in Bend, my fiance and I decided to move here. That was three years ago, and now we can&#8217;t imagine being anywhere else.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>What was your very first job?<\/strong>\u00a0My first job was working as a lifeguard at a public pool in Eugene, OR. I was paid minimum wage, which was $6.25 at the time. I never had to save anyone from drowning, but I did have to make sure kids didn&#8217;t get into the hot tub.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A big heartfelt THANK YOU to Julie and Robert with Cascade Angels, for sponsoring this contest and growing and supporting entrepreneurship in Central Oregon.
