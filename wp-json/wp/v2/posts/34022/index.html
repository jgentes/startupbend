So when the team at Craft CMS\u2014a tech company mostly new to Bend\u2014compared one of their primary competitors to a chicken nugget (they\u2019re more of a custom sandwich, made on artisanal bread, with heirloom tomatoes and other delicious things) I had to know more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-thirds of the team at Craft CMS are new arrivals to town. Founder and CEO Brandon Kelly started Craft\u2019s parent company, Pixel &amp; Tonic, a software development agency specializing in ExpressionEngine add-ons, in San Jose in early 2011. But he quickly realized that he wanted to do something more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wanted to do my own CMS,\u201d Brandon says. The company\u2019s CTO Brad jokes that every developer wants to write his or her own CMS\u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a rite of passage.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, though, that rite of passage evolved into one of the most well-respected CMS products on the market, with the likes of Salesforce, The Associated Press, and Netflix in its client roster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>A different approach<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now getting back to the chicken nugget. As Craft team notes, the CMS world primarily exists on the opposing ends of a spectrum. There\u2019s the nearly free, very templated, DIY products such as WordPress (aka chicken nuggets) on one end and very expensive, enterprise-level products on the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33932\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33932\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33932\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160614_094137-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"The Craft CMS team: Founder Brandon Kelly, CTO Brad Bell and CCO Leslie Camacho. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-wp-pid=\"33932\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160614_094137-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160614_094137-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160614_094137-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160614_094137-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33932\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Craft CMS team: Founder Brandon Kelly, CTO Brad Bell and CCO Leslie Camacho.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craft CMS takes a different approach, targeting web professionals who want to create their own site designs. \u201cThey want to have control over their content, and we want to make sure their content shines,\u201d Brandon says. There\u2019s no templates; instead developers can use Craft to create beautifully custom sites, using Twig as their templating language. There\u2019s a bit more training involved for developers, but the results are far from cookie cutter. And the cost? It\u2019s $299 per site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandon and his team hit a sweet spot with this approach, attracting a following of web development agencies and freelance developers who prefer their product. Nearly all of the company\u2019s business comes from these fans, who recommend Craft CMS to their client base.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bend bound<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how did Craft end up in Bend? Well, Brandon and Brad hired Leslie Camacho as the company\u2019s Chief Customer Officer in January. Leslie was actually the former CEO of EllisLab, the company that makes ExpressionEngine. Basically, they\u2019d all known each other for a long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leslie has lived in Bend\u2013and worked remotely\u2014for nine years. When Brandon came to visit him last April, he fell in love with Central Oregon. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe people actually live like this,\u201d Brandon says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So he moved here earlier this year. Then Brad moved here. And now the trio behind Craft CMS work out of an office in BendTECH. The company\u2019s customer base is global, in fact a peek at the Craft CMS website reveals Craft developer meetups all around the world, so the location doesn\u2019t matter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe found a place where everyone is happy,\u201d Brandon says. \u201cIn fact, being in Bend has even helped us.\u201d That\u2019s primarily through the connections the company has made with Bend startups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company is enjoying steady growth, and right now is focused on building Craft 3.0, a major overhaul to the codebase that will make life more pleasant for plugin developers, Brandon says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I love a good metaphor.
