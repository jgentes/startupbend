Chris, a serial entrepreneur willing to share the good, bad and ugly about startup life, posted a thoughtful piece on Medium Tuesday about what went wrong &#8212; as well as right.<\/p>\n<p>Chris started Nacho Cove in 2012. Our long-time readers (Hi Mom and Dad!) might recall that we profiled the <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-nacho-cove-aims-to-tame-corporate-email\/\">company as one of our #50startups<\/a>;\u00a0its headquarters were technically Portland, though Chris, the company&#8217;s CEO, is in Bend. Nacho Cove created an email client &#8212; Nacho Mail, which integrates your email, calendar and contacts, and adapts to users needs through its AI management tool. They <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/nacho-cove-receives-1-million-in-seed-funding\/\">closed a $1 million seed round last July<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Chris is no stranger to startups. He previously co-founded Nukona, the first complete Enterprise Mobile Management solution, which was subsequently purchased by Symantec a scant 18 months after it started.<\/p>\n<p>From his <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@mobileperret\/shutting-down-a-failing-startup-bacde9171745#.3mlnee240\">medium post<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"1104\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Current situation\u200a\u2014\u200awe went after an old\/stale technology, building an enterprise communication (email\/chat\/to-do) tool that had the ability to prioritize actions based on what mattered to the individual. That\u2019s right, we went after the email problem that plagues every individual who works in a large company. We got a few patents, built a great tool (better than anything on market) and did it on a shoestring. Two competitors emerged, spending 10X what we spent to build technology that was less capable, less secure and less enterprise focused.<\/p>\n<p id=\"94b6\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">So here\u2019s the deal\u200a\u2014\u200awe did NOT get acquired while the other guys did. And now, cuz I don\u2019t want to throw good money after bad, we are shutting down the company and merging technology with a few other firms. It SUCKS!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Chris then walks through what his competitors did better than Nacho Cove. I&#8217;ll let you <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@mobileperret\/shutting-down-a-failing-startup-bacde9171745#.3mlnee240\">read the whole post,<\/a> which is worth four minutes of your time. But here&#8217;s a few of the highlights:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Their competitors moved faster.<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Their competitors spent more on marketing.<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Nacho Cove tried to have work-life balance (Balance doesn&#8217;t work in startups, Chris writes)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>He expands on these points and more, offering some great advice. Chris also discusses what the company did right, including believing in the product and not wasting investor dollars. What&#8217;s next? Chris notes that he&#8217;s helping his team find jobs, and that there are\u00a0&#8220;several folks that are likely to use our technology to help their own efforts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"9185\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">On a personal level, this has been a kick in the teeth. I hate, absolutely hate not winning. That said, every time I look at what we did, and our outcome, I have not seen steps that we would have made differently (at the time we made those decisions). I\u2019ve learned far more than I wanted to about this aspect of startup life.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">I was bummed to hear this news. But I do want to thank Chris. Because goodness knows we love to hear about money raised, people hired, projected growth and general winning. But\u00a0man, it&#8217;s helpful to hear founders discuss startups that didn&#8217;t work and what they learned. Those reflections are a gift to entrepreneurs in the trenches. So Chris, I&#8217;m grateful for your insights &#8212; others are too &#8212; and I&#8217;m looking forward to see what you do next.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nacho Cove, an email startup co-founded by Bendite Chris Perret, is closing down.
