First, meet <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinktanky.com\/\">Think Tanky<\/a>, a consulting firm started here in Bend by Amy Doherty. Amy is drawing on her deep experience with nonprofits to help for-profit companies integrate their values and social impact intentions with their business.<\/p>\n<p>Second, for her Think Tanky blog, Amy interviewed Shannon Keith, founder of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sudara.org\/collections\/PUNJAMMIES?gclid=CLrx4ZOm49ECFQ9EfgodLv8G6A\"> Sudara<\/a>, about her Bend-based company that sells loungewear made by women who are survivors of India&#8217;s sex slave trade. Shannon pitched Sudara during the <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/bvc-2016-introduces-new-social-impact-track\/\">Bend Venture Conference Social Impact<\/a> track event, and her passion for her company is contagious.<\/p>\n<p>So take a few minutes to learn more about Sudara, explore Think Tanky and contemplate how for-profit businesses can be a world-changing force for good. Happy Friday!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from Amy&#8217;s blog post featuring Sudara:<\/p>\n<div id=\"block-d2cb534c7faa79efc99e\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p><em>This November, I had the privilege of not only watching Shannon Keith, Sudara\u2019s CEO and Founder, deliver a powerful pitch to win <a href=\"http:\/\/bendvc.edcoinfo.com\/about\/\">BVC\u2019s first Social Impact competition<\/a>, but I interviewed Shannon in Sudara\u2019s home office and collection center right here in Bend, Oregon, Think Tanky\u2019s own backyard. Sudara sells beautiful pajama pants for adults and kids that are sewn by girls and women in India who have escaped the sex trade. Each pajama pattern tells a story of survival and each purchase supports freedom and a new life. It\u2019s with great appreciation that I was able to interview Shannon about Sudara\u2019s current season (Bold Journey) and learn more about impact shopping and, of course, what size I should order.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Amy: According to the United Nations, human trafficking is the third largest organized crime behind drugs and arms trading. Yet, there\u2019s resistance around sex trafficking awareness and surprise that it\u2019s so prevalent in India. What\u2019s your take and what\u2019s your message here?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nShannon: I don\u2019t think that it is overestimated and, if you think about it logically, not justifying it of course, but if you think of those other crimes, there are many penalties and laws for fighting drugs and arms trade, whereas trade in human flesh is more of a cultural norm in India that\u2019s pretty widely accepted. \u00a0Although prostitution is illegal on the books in India, the caste system sees girls in the lower caste or \u201cuntouchables\u201d as less. For example, there are temple prostitutes, girls from that caste system, young girls, who, as a part of the Hindu religion that feeds into it and normalizes this injustice within this cultural [framework], their lives don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a highly complex and difficult culture for Americans to understand. Certain groups or \u201cuntouchables\u201d are the lowest caste and aren\u2019t considered equals of the higher castes. For instance, there\u2019s the Dalit caste who are the lowest level and therefore given the worst jobs like sex trade or sewage cleaning that no other person in the society is signing up to do. Again, it\u2019s a cultural norm so people aren\u2019t changing systemically, but this is certainly part of the challenge. Sudara isn\u2019t trying to change culture but some aspects of Indian culture are changing, especially with the growing global awareness of human sex trafficking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amy: Would women\u2019s rights be different based on where you fell in the caste system?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nShannon: This is such a complicated culture, as you know, and so there\u2019s not a pat answer. But I think so, although there are no easy answers to that, especially in a complex culture like India.<\/p>\n<p>The Indian culture we may be familiar with, those from the highest caste can become physicians, architects, doctors, these women seem to be liberated and free to choose. However, that\u2019s a small percentage of the 1.3 billion population, so there aren\u2019t low caste women holding these positions or getting these opportunities. It\u2019s tricky to comprehend from our western perspective where women have more choices and we see these higher caste women who are Bollywood actresses, lawyers, etc., but they are the exception. It\u2019s not the Cinderella rags to riches story, that\u2019s not a possibility in Indian culture. Riches beget riches, especially in Indian culture.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_3_1481501291282_10311\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p>Sudara operates in the four major cities: Mumbai, Calcutta, Hydrobad and Chennai, where the largest concentration of sex trafficking takes place. Our partners are working in these larger cities, where we also focus our efforts. The women and girls have often been trafficked from all over India but the vast majority are from smaller rural communities. They\u2019ve gotten duped or stolen into the sex trade because their families may not have been able to care for them. These girls are from hard or poor backgrounds. For example, their father dies and the mother is struggling to support her kids and someone says there\u2019s a job opportunity in Calcutta in this hotel, etc. So the girl leaves and is never heard from again and no money is exchanged. It\u2019s truly tragic. These families are getting duped easily, it\u2019s prevalent, and it is the most common way for girls to end up in these brothels.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, my family and I worked with an NGO that builds water wells in areas where there was need. It was on my second trip that I discovered an area where children were running around everywhere in the middle of the day, they weren\u2019t in school, and I asked about them. \u00a0We began asking more and more questions, this was before sex trafficking was a known term. Since then, there has been more exposure, the media and investigative journalist networks have started to expose this harsh reality like in the documentary film Born into Brothels: Calcutta\u2019s Red Light District, or Slumdog Millionaire. \u00a0Slowly there\u2019s been more exposure to what IS happening \u2013 there\u2019s organized crime behind much of this \u2013 the system is broken when it comes to child welfare and it\u2019s the worst for women. \u00a0A woman has a brick wall over her head, not just a glass ceiling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amy: Where do you see the consumer (in this case the Westerner) interacting or connecting with the source of the products they buy? You\u2019re working with girls who were sold by their parents or stolen into a horrific nightmare and giving them the opportunity to make real wages and receive the dignity that comes from work \u2013 the empowerment. What\u2019s the lesson here?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nShannon: You\u2019ve heard the phrase \u2018first world problem\u2019 and that plays in here because what Sudara is doing is new and different. It\u2019s a different way to shop, it\u2019s awareness of supply chain. And that supply chain is a crew of highly sexually traumatized girls and women living in India. But also, we know our supply chain, we\u2019re very aware of the source and that is a new model. Most companies, such as large retail stores, could not tell you much about their supply chain or source. Part of that is because it\u2019s cheaper for the consumer if it\u2019s cheap to make and if the workers aren\u2019t being paid or looked after well. And this isn\u2019t a judgment call, it\u2019s a fact. Sudara is pushing the envelope when it comes to supply chain and exposing our customers to the women and girls \u2013 the people behind the product. \u00a0Sex trafficking is not at all an easy conversation but it needs to happen for anything to change. When people sitting in their living rooms in Bend, Oregon can make a purchase that gives a girl in Mumbai money to pay for basic needs and receive therapies and support on many different levels, that transaction is powerful and it\u2019s a shift. Change is never easy and Sudara has moved away from the traditional business format, and that shifts the consumer\u2019s responsibility in all of this as well. Suddenly, your \u2018first world problem\u2019 falls into perspective when you are exposed to the realities and horrible conditions that people are experiencing around the world. So why not shop somewhere that makes a difference directly? It is not the easy way to go. This has not been easy and was not the easy route, this is the challenging route, but it\u2019s worth it when you go to India to hear the stories of the girls it affects and realize purchases do have power. There IS a better way businesses can do business.<\/p>\n<p>Sudara\u2019s business plan is the harder path and yet, we have customers who call and are furious that their package is late when there was a monsoon and things were slowed down. Our customers are freaking out on us and have yelled at some of our customer service reps \u2013 this is the first world problem \u2013 that their pajamas are a few days late. It\u2019s a larger call for <em>slow fashion <\/em>to have a bigger place at the table.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amy: <em>Slow Fashion<\/em>&#8230;that\u2019s a term now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shannon: Yes, it\u2019s a growing movement. Slow Fashion is a return to artisanship and handmade products much like locavore and movements that ask consumers to be aware of source. Change is difficult, though, and some consumers are still slow to make this shift. My staff understands that this change is slow and that Sudara is part of a new consumer experience; we would also ask shoppers to show a bit more humanity when dealing with social impact companies. Our cause is in the DNA of everything we do, on our walls (see pics) in our fabric \u2013 everything. We\u2019re redefining the norm and we want to create change that\u2019s much larger than Sudara. We don\u2019t want people to buy their slave sourced supply chain products \u2013 chocolate, coffee, technology \u2013 everybody chooses the cheaper way which is to pay cheaper wages. This is a call for a unilateral shift across all businesses.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_3_1481501291282_12461\" class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\">\n<div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thinktanky.com\/sudara\/\">Read the rest here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some blog posts have just one cool thing&#8211;this one actually has two, so because bang for your buck.
