This blog continues a series of selfies + blogs about the amazing people she\u2019s met in the last couple of years. #julieselfie<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Recently, I had a wonderful visit with Meg Chun, co-founder and CEO at <a href=\"https:\/\/kialoa.com\/\">KIALOA<\/a>, a Bend-based paddle company. Our conversation covered the early days of the company in Hawaii and making paddles on the lanai, moving to Bend and working out of a garage, her international paddle collection and Central Oregon\u2019s growth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where did the idea come from for KIALOA and why Central Oregon? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KIALOA started on Oahu. My husband Dave and I were avid outrigger paddlers and Dave felt that there was a way to improve upon the paddles that we were using.\u00a0He had strong beliefs about paddle design so he started building paddles on our lanai.<\/p>\n<p>In 1992, after much research, we decided to move to Bend, Oregon because we couldn\u2019t afford to buy a house in Hawaii. We\u2019ve been Bendites ever since.\u00a0 Today KIALOA sells 20,000 paddles a year to outrigger paddlers, SUP paddlers, dragon boat paddlers and kayakers around the world and is regarded as one of the best paddle companies on the planet.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34078\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34078\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34078\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1535-1-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Harrelson w\/ Meg Chun, co-founder of the KIALOA paddle company. \" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-wp-pid=\"34078\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1535-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1535-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1535-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1535-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1535-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34078\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie Harrelson w\/ Meg Chun, co-founder of the KIALOA paddle company.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Favorite mentor or inspiration?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to go way back here.\u00a0The person who came to mind is Lynette Fassbender, my \u00a0\u201ccooperating teacher\u201d when I was\u00a0a student teacher working with emotionally disturbed adolescents.\u00a0She taught me how to draw boundaries, how to be kind but firm, how to manage difficult people and how to embrace individual differences.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34079\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34079\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34079 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1647-500x500.jpg\" alt=\"img_1647\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-wp-pid=\"34079\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1647-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1647-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1647-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1647.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34079\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">So many beautiful paddles.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nWhat are your top three suggestions to entrepreneurs starting out?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have been asked this question multiple times and the same answer has always held true.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep a low personal overhead so you have options.<\/li>\n<li>Ask for help and set up a mentor support system.<\/li>\n<li>Surround yourself with great people who share your values<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>If you could go paddling right now, where would you go?
