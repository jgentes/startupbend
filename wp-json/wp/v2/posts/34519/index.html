The company was founded with the goal of creating meaningful ways for people to feel connected with the outdoors in their everyday lives. Their monthly subscription box service introduces people to innovative new products and gear that inspires them to get outdoors and try new things, go new places, and share the experience with others.<\/p>\n<p>In the fall of 2014, Cairn was a member of the first class of <a href=\"http:\/\/bendoutdoorworx.com\/\">Bend Outdoor Worx<\/a>, an accelerator for Central Oregon outdoor-product companies. At the start of 2015, the company, founded by Rob Little and Jared Peterson, had two employees and approximately 500 subscribers. Today Cairn has 14 employees, ships products to over 15,000 subscribers each month, and sources products from over 100 companies. Cairn, based in Bend, was chosen among all development stage companies in Oregon as the winner of the Oregon Entrepreneurs Network Entrepreneurship Award in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Cascade Angels participated invested in a $2M round in May of 2016 that included several strategic investors. Cairn is the first Cascade Angels consumer products portfolio company. As noted by many, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/gretchenfox\/2016\/11\/22\/how-the-outdoor-industry-is-creating-a-huge-boom-in-bend\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/www.google.com\/&amp;referrer=https:\/\/www.google.com\/\">including a recent Forbes article<\/a>, there is a growing critical mass in the outdoor industry in Central Oregon, positioning the area as a potential hub for outdoor product innovation. I recently caught up with Rob Little and Jared Peterson at Cairn to talk their growth, their collaboration and the band that ties it all together&#8211;Creedence Clearwater Revival.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34520\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34520\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34520\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2595-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2595-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2595.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie and Cairn co-founders Jared Peterson and Rob Little.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Julie: You met at Wharton business school.
