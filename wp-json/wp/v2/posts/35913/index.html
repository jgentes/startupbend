Well, Cascade Angels has been quietly doing the work of building its investment fund and our startup ecosystem since its inception in 2014, and the effort is absolutely paying off.<\/p>\n<p>The Bend-based angel fund announced that its fifth fund, a multi-year fund launched this year, is its largest at $3 million. That fund made seven investments in 2018, totaling $1.1 million dollars and supporting startups across a range of industries.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFund V is 2.5 times larger than last year\u2019s fund and over seven times larger than our first fund in 2014,\u201d says Fund Manager Julie Harrelson. \u201cThis allows us to make more investments of larger dollar amounts, while still being focused on a part of the market underserved by individual angel investors and larger venture capital firms.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35914\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35914\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35914\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CascadeAngels-2309-Edit-500x334.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CascadeAngels-2309-Edit-500x334.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CascadeAngels-2309-Edit.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Julie Harrelson and Robert Pease, fund managers of Cascade Angels.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Cascade Angels has made two dozen investments since it began, totaling nearly $4 million.
