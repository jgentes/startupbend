She is also the former concertmaster of the Central Oregon Symphony.<\/p>\n<p>She says:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This course was a request by people who felt that if they could get some stage time at the Tower, that they could be free to speak anytime, anywhere, no matter how high the pressure. I really wanted to honor their request because when you can ROCK in front of an audience, it opens up enormous doors of opportunity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The course runs Mondays, Feb. 20, Feb. 27 and March 6 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>The cost is $270, if you&#8217;ve worked with Diane before.
