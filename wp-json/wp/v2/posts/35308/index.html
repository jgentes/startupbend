Yong organized a hackathon Saturday aimed at finding a way to help the nonprofit Guardian Group more efficiently fight online sex trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the Guardian Group, <a href=\"https:\/\/theguardiangroup.org\/\">take some time to learn about their work<\/a>. The Bend-based organization is &#8220;made up of former special operations military, law enforcement and intelligence community professionals, all working to end sex trafficking in the United States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendbulletin.com\/localstate\/5916942-151\/students-use-computer-skills-to-counter-sex-trafficking\">Bulletin covered the event<\/a>, noting that:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Newstext\">The Guardian Group searches the websites looking for ads and information. Team members then manually use publicly available search engines and programs online to connect information on the victims and send reports to law enforcement. On Saturday, the students worked to make the process less time consuming by compiling all the different search engines and programs into one location.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Yong told StartupBend that for the Guardian Group, &#8220;this daily triaging of new information can be labor-intensive, and I noticed some straightforward opportunities to save the Guardian Group analysts some time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The hackathon participants built and released a Google Chrome extension designed to automate a small, but cumbersome and time-consuming step in the workflow of Guardian Group analysts. Yong says that the nonprofit is already using the extension, and that his students have even more ideas for facilitating that workflow.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35309\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35309\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-35309 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hackathon-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hackathon-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hackathon-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/hackathon-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">OSU CS students volunteering their skills to help fight human trafficking.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The event was sponsored by\u00a0Shape Integrated Software and TEKSystems, which provided food for the students.
