The question poses a conundrum for enterprising founders who see the benefit of increased exposure but have limited time, money, resources and money to focus on PR.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why a targeted approach is so crucial. And yet &#8230; and I say this with love &#8230; many of you are doing it wrong. I am not a public relations specialist. But I have spent 15 years writing for all manner of publications from teeny tiny weekly newspapers to wire services to national magazines to this very blog.<\/p>\n<p>By my rough estimate, I\u2019ve probably read or heard about a bazillion story pitches from entrepreneurs. So here is my free, mostly unsolicited, advice for how to improve your press strategy and hopefully score some valuable coverage for your fledgling company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Figure out what you want and who can provide it. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For founders with limited resources the key is to first determine why you want press now and what audience you\u2019re trying to reach. The answers to those questions will point you toward who you should contact. Are you wanting to spark investor interest or looking to hire? Then tech blogs might be your best bet. Are you looking for more clients for your B2B software? Spend time talking to industry publications that serve your niche. Not all press is created equal. A big story in your local newspaper is awesome, but if you\u2019re trying to reach a specific type of client, a pitch to a small, but targeted blog could ultimately have a bigger impact. Make the\u00a0 most of your efforts by identifying what you want, and then match your goal to a specific audience and publication.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Be clear. Be very, very clear.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Occasionally one of my reporter or writer friends will post a press release from a (usually tech) startup on their Facebook page. Why? Well &#8230; I\u2019m sorry to say that it\u2019s usually to giggle at the jargon and ponder what the company actually does. These posts get a lot of likes, but not the kind that I imagine that the company founders wanted.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a startup, you probably make something. Please say what that thing is: software, an app, maybe a tiny robot that delivers donuts to tech bloggers. If you want to use the word &#8220;solution,&#8221; I won\u2019t stop you. But concretely describe what your solution entails. You don\u2019t need to dumb your language down, however you do need to be precise and clear. Your goal is to be featured in a journalist\u2019s publication &#8212; not in her Facebook feed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Talk to the right people.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year I had a startup founder tell me that her company had emailed some really big news to the top editor of a newspaper. And they didn\u2019t hear back. Was it because the news wasn\u2019t worthy of coverage? No. It\u2019s probably because they emailed the wrong person. Find the reporters, bloggers and other media types who cover what you do. Contact them. They\u2019re the ones putting together the stories, and if they have an editor, they\u2019re the ones telling them why the story is worth doing at all.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile their bosses are busy. When I worked in daily newspapers I would sometimes fill in as business editor. There were days that I spent 6-plus hours in meetings. I didn\u2019t respond to email pitches. I didn\u2019t even eat lunch. Meanwhile the reporters were out actively looking for things to write about. Cultivate a relationship with the people who will be telling your story.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Go beyond your product.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course you want to talk about\u00a0 your product. And you should. But in many cases that makes for one story to tell (at least until you have more news such as investment or additional products). In the meantime, look for additional ways to get media attention. Expand your narrative, mine your areas of expertise and find new ways to pitch your business.\u00a0Bend-based startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getcairn.com\/\">Cairn<\/a> offers a great example. The subscription box company saw an opportunity for their product to be included in holiday gift lists, pitched publications and landed in holiday gift guides for Backpacker Magazine, 1859 Magazine to name just a few.<\/p>\n<p>So contemplate: Does your company make you an expert in something specific such as cyber security or marketing automation or online donut delivery? Then pitch a story on that, with yourself as the primary source. Are you part of a larger trend? Are you responding to a unique problem? Can you tie your product to something happening in the news or an upcoming holiday? There\u2019s more than one way to crack the nut of press coverage. If you\u2019re striking out with a simple story about your product, regroup and see what other types of stories you have to offer the world.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that some positive press aimed at the right audience can help your company grow. And you may not need even the help of a PR firm. But you do need to take the time to craft a thoughtful approach that tells the right story to the right people.<\/p>\n<p><em>Kelly Kearsley writes and edits most of this blog.
