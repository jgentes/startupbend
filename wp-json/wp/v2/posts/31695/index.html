The more complex and convoluted your reservation system is, the better our system can help. An example of our client might be a destination resort in Mexico that offers its guests activities such scuba lessons and whale watching tours. We manage the whole thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea?<\/strong> I used to be an assistant principal at a high school. I would spend the summers as a fly fishing guide. I thought that there must be a better way to manage the reservations. We were living in Portland at the time, and we ended up selling our house and cashing in our retirement to fund the first software product, which was aimed strictly at fishing guide companies.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31697\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31697\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31697\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-500x305.jpg\" alt=\"The Flybook co-founder Craig Langer.\" width=\"500\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-500x305.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-1024x625.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-800x489.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26.jpg 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31697\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Flybook co-founder Craig Langer.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>What happened with that first product? <\/strong>We had several hundred clients, ranging from very small to very large outfitters. But, this was our first go at it, and there was ample room for improvement. On the technology side of things, we had a pretty long list of enhancements piled up. We wanted to provide a better user experience. On the business side of things, our pricing model wasn\u2019t creating the right behavior in customers. The combination of all this \u2013 over five years\u2019 worth of hard-earned lessons from these outdoor service providers &#8211; we knew we could make a better product. We knew we could expand beyond fly fishing. So we ended up starting over.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What did that entail?<\/strong> We decided to target the entire outdoor rec and tourism industry. We really needed something that would scale. We rebuilt our system, made all the necessary enhancements to improve the experience, and contacted all of our original clients to change them to a monthly fee pricing. We actually ended up overhauling all but 20% of our entire client portfolio immediately. We doubled our revenue in that first month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You landed at BVC shortly after?<\/strong> We did. We didn\u2019t win, but we gained a ton of exposure. And it was a great exercise having all those people put pressure on our business model and try to poke holes in it. We learned a great deal through that process. We had a lot of investors approach us after the fact, but none of the deals were a great fit. We\u2019re still fully bootstrapped.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you actively fundraising?<\/strong> No. The door isn\u2019t shut though. If we stumbled upon the perfect partner, we are certainly open to it. We are growing at what we think is a good clip without it, and we aren\u2019t desperate for it. We are a pretty gritty team, and we are all on the same page with the end goal. For now, it\u2019s really nice to make our own decisions and do what\u2019s right for our customers and our business vs. the investor bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When did you relocate to Bend?<\/strong> <strong>Was that a challenge for your company?<\/strong> We moved here in 2013. It\u2019s been great for us. I think this place is filled with competent, passionate smart people who are looking for opportunity. I was pleasantly surprised at the great start-up and entrepreneur community here; it feels great to be a part of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How\u2019s business now? <\/strong>We have a 95% retention rate and customers in 48 states and nine countries. We\u2019re set to triple our revenue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next for The Flybook?<\/strong> We\u2019re continuing to grow and we\u2019ll have some new products to release soon. It\u2019s mostly about getting the word out and continuing to grow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Flybook\u2019s clients provide people with all sorts of fun from guided fly fishing and river rafting trips to walking tours and destination lodges.
