That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re so excited to announce the Startup Founders Office program, which allows us to support more early stage entrepreneurs with free space, awesome expertise, and a supportive community ready to help you get your business off the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vision is pretty simple: Put founders in a supportive place, connect them with experts in funding, marketing, operations, product development and more. Then let them focus and work, with people who have been-there, done-that an arm&#8217;s length away available for questions, venting. Interrupt sometimes with free coffee and beer, for good measure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The awesome community support that the SFO has received from sponsors who are truly committed to making Bend the best place to launch and grow a business is the icing on the cake. They&#8217;re listed below, but if you see them say thanks. Because they rock. OK I&#8217;m done.
