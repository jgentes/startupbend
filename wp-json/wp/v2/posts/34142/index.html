Launched in August, her software was selected as one of eight products vying for the title Next Great HR Technology Company last week at the HR Tech Conference in Chicago. Her company finished in the top four.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have idea \u2013 will travel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The seed for Dana\u2019s product came via frustration; she grew tired of so many companies having an ad hoc process and no good tools for handling employee claims of harassment and discrimination. She notes that employment and labor law attorneys are often reluctant to do the investigations because of regulations that say if the case goes to court, they can\u2019t represent their client.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34143\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34143\" style=\"width: 333px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34143\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Web-Pic-2014-333x500.jpg\" alt=\"Dana Barbato, founder of InvestiPro. \" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" data-wp-pid=\"34143\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Web-Pic-2014-333x500.jpg 333w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Web-Pic-2014.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34143\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dana Barbato, founder of InvestiPro.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cSo lots of companies will bring in consultants, but now there\u2019s several states that don\u2019t allow consultants,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are really no tools out there.\u201d So Dana moved to Bend two years ago to join her grown children here and began building InvestiPro last year.<\/p>\n<p>She came up with the concept and hired developers to create the software. As Dana describes it, the product provides training to HR professionals and managers regarding employment investigations and then walks them through a step-by-step process, denoting which questions to ask and what actions to take.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt calculates everything together into a nice succinct report that is legally compliant in all 50 states,\u201d she says. Companies can then take the findings to attorneys if they need further advice, or take corrective based on the report.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Industry attention<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>InvestiPro is priced per use. So a company would pay about $500 to use it for one investigation, with companies with larger needs able to purchase larger packages. The key thing, Dana says, is that simply showing you have a dedicated, repeatable investigations process can prevent complaints from turning into lawsuits.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34144\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34144\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34144\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Dashboard-with-icons-500x281.png\" alt=\"InvestiPro dashboard. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-wp-pid=\"34144\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Dashboard-with-icons-500x281.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Dashboard-with-icons-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Dashboard-with-icons.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34144\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">InvestiPro dashboard.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cFifty-three percent of claims were automatically denied by the EEOC in 2014 based on the fact that that company did a proper investigation,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>She\u2019ll be presenting InvestiPro at the BVC <span data-term=\"goog_707038936\">on Thursday<\/span> as part of the early stage competition.
