For Zealios, a formerly Berkeley-based startup that recently relocated to Bend, it\u2019s their line of personal products and triathletes. \u201cThe second we dipped our toe into the triathlete community, we started growing,\u201d says Austin Britts, Zealios co-founder.<\/p>\n<p>Britts and his co-founder, Kevin Fuller, started<a href=\"http:\/\/teamzealios.com\/\"> Zealios<\/a> in 2009 in a quest to develop a better zinc-based sunscreen &#8212; one that\u00a0 was water and sweat proof, lasted through workouts and didn\u2019t turn your face white.<\/p>\n<p>The pair were coworkers at a chemical trading company in Seattle, and they were intimately familiar with all the ingredients that go into skincare products, the good and the bad. \u201cWe wanted to create a product that performed really well and was really safe,\u201d Britts says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33804\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33804\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-33804\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/zealios_products.png\" alt=\"Zealios' product line\" width=\"475\" height=\"480\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zealios&#8217; product line, photo courtesy teamzealios.com\u00a0<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>They worked on Zealios on the side of their day jobs, first launching their sunscreen in 2011 and then later a well-received line of swim shampoo and body wash. They also triumphed over near disaster: After raising $50,000 in seed money to fund their first production order, a supposed business partner took the money and disappeared. \u201cWe had 60% of our seed money stolen,\u201d Britts says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33805\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33805\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33805\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Austin_pic-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Austin Britts, Zealios co-founder\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Austin Britts, Zealios co-founder<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Not to state the obvious, but that was a low point. (The founders won a lawsuit and are now trying to collect those funds, Britts reports). They quickly regrouped, doubled down with their own savings and started again. Both Fuller and Britts are longtime rugby players, and in fact, played semi-professionally after college. So they\u2019re tough cookies, and in this case, they got knocked down and came back fighting.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, they quit their jobs to work on Zealios full-time. Britts relocated from California to Bend last summer. He\u2019d long wanted to move to Bend, and then after seeing the support for outdoor products companies here, he pulled the trigger. \u201cWe met with Gary Bracelin (of Bend Outdoor Worx), local business owners and the Oregon Outdoor Association,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone was incredible, super welcoming and willing to help and make connections &#8212; it was amazing.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33806\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33806\" style=\"width: 181px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33806\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kevin_pic-e1461785376651-181x250.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Fuller, Zealios co-founder.\" width=\"181\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33806\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Fuller, Zealios co-founder.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The company also really dialed into local triathlete scene, bringing on Jesse Thomas and Heather Jackson as brand ambassadors, going to events and providing products for athletes to try. \u201cIn terms of skin care, there was really nothing culturally attached to triathletes,\u201d he says. \u201cOur products are perfect for them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now, the company is humming. Zealios hired its first employee last year, grew 300% and is on track to hit more $500,000 in revenue in 2016. \u201cI think now we really feel like a startup because we have startup problems that come from growing fast, like trying to manage our cash flow and growth,\u201d Britts says.<\/p>\n<p>The products are for sale on Amazon, in retail shops in California, including Mike Bike\u2019s and at the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/teamzealios.com\/\">website<\/a>. Britts and Fuller\u00a0 are even starting to train for their first triathlon, an effort to honor a rugby friend who recently passed away.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not built for distance,\u201d Britts says. \u201cBut istanding on a finish line of a tri is amazingly inspirational and makes you want to be a part of it.\u201d Welcome to Bend Zealios!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup:<\/strong> Zealios<br \/>\n<strong>Founders:<\/strong> Austin Britts and Kevin Fuller<br \/>\n<strong>First product on market:<\/strong> 2011<br \/>\n<strong>Employees:<\/strong> 3<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes things just naturally go together, like peanut butter and jelly or puffy coats and shorts.
