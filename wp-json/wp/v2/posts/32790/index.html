What if instead of simply finding more expensive space in Silicon Valley, he moved his office &#8212; and willing employees &#8212; to Bend?<\/p>\n<p>That idea became reality in July. Kollective will celebrate <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/meet-kollective-at-open-house-aug-27th\/\">the grand opening of its new 4,000-square-foot space in the 1001 Tech Center next week<\/a>. And though some startup founders here have faced questions and skepticism about the viability of scaling a tech company outside of a major tech city, Vetras has turned that concern on its head.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI realized that managing and maintaining a VC-funded startup in Silicon Valley was becoming cost prohibitive,\u201d he says. &#8220;Investors are very\u00a0reluctant\u00a0to spend their money on\u00a0things\u00a0that are not core to running\u00a0the\u00a0company or that appear to be overly inflated by abnormal market demand.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For example, he notes that the Bay Area commercial real estate market is dominated by giant tech companies. Kollective was asked to move from its space so the building owner could make room for much larger neighbor. But when Vetras began to look for a similar digs, he faced paying three times what his previous lease had been to be in Sunnyvale or the surrounding area.<\/p>\n<p>Recruiting employees in direct competition with employers like Apple or Facebook is another challenge. For a cost-conscious startup it&#8217;s hard to provide comparable perks (onsite dry cleaning anyone?) while also offering salaries that keep pace with the cost of living in Northern California, Vetras says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe needed to find a way to get to cash-flow positive faster, and improve the quality of life our employees,\u201d he says. \u201cI realized Bend could be someplace we could go.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32791\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32791\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bend3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32791\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bend3-500x334.jpg\" alt=\"Kollective employees working at Stackhouse Coffee at the 1001 building. \" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bend3-500x334.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bend3.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32791\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kollective employees working at Stackhouse Coffee at the 1001 building.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/kollective.com\/\">Kollective<\/a> was founded as Kontiki in 2001 and rebranded as Kollective earlier this year. Its cloud-based products, including the Kontiki Business Video platform, help corporations deliver video and large files to their employees and clients.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, consider how a corporation with tens of thousands of employees lives streams and then stores a speech by their CEO or distributes a series of internal training videos. Kollective makes that process seamless and secure. The company employs about 60 people in California, London, Bangalore and now Bend.<\/p>\n<p>Vetras\u00a0 was introduced to Central Oregon by his friend and Kollective board observer Dino Vendetti, general partner of Bend-based Seven Peaks Ventures (now Kollective&#8217;s neighbor at 1001). As Vetras investigated Bend, he liked what he saw.<\/p>\n<p>There was a small, but growing tech community. The housing and office space were reasonably priced relative to California.\u00a0The weather was warm and dry.\u00a0And Bend was in the same time zone and just one flight away from San Francisco. However the CEO wanted buy-in from his employees before he could make a decision.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32792\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32792\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team-dan-vetras-450x450.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-32792\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team-dan-vetras-450x450.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Vetras, CEO of Kollective. \" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team-dan-vetras-450x450.jpg 450w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/team-dan-vetras-450x450-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32792\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dan Vetras, CEO of Kollective.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be just me saying I wanted to move here,\u201d he says.

That was enough for Vetras.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re the early adopters,\u201d he says. The company took on smaller space in Sunnyvale for its remaining California employees. And Kollective realized a 65% savings in its commercial real estate costs by opening the Bend office.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve cut the burn in ways in we can control &#8212; without affecting the business,\u201d Vetras says. &#8220;We can now invest back into\u00a0the\u00a0business\u00a0itself through the money we save on\u00a0the real estate and\u00a0compensation\u00a0fronts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32793\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Kollective-team.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32793\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Kollective-team-500x334.jpg\" alt=\"The Kollective team. \" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Kollective-team-500x334.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Kollective-team.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Kollective team.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The company is poised for growth.
