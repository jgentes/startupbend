A group of women entrepreneurs, investors and lenders debuted the XXcelerate Fund on Tuesday. The fund is designed to fill the capital gap that many women entrepreneurs face.<\/p>\n<p>From the XXcelerate news release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThere is a crisis in access to capital and entrepreneurial support for women in the state of Oregon and nationwide,\u201d said Robin Klemm, PH.D., Board Member and Executive Director, XXcelerate Fund. \u201cAnd this gap is happening at a time when we see continuing proof points of the effectiveness of women business leaders.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The fund&#8217;s founders surveyed women entrepreneurs in Portland and discovered that they faced distinct challenges in obtaining capital, despite their entrepreneurial chops. The survey revealed that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>40 percent of founders surveyed identify as underrepresented\/people of color.<\/li>\n<li>Most have been denied traditional funding sources.<\/li>\n<li>Nearly all have been through an incubator, accelerator, or previous business training.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, the Portland Business Journal noted:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Women start businesses at twice the rate as men, according to an Oppenheimer funds study. Yet a report by the U.S. Senate on barriers to entrepreneurship found that women receive just 5 percent of total dollars in conventional small business loans.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>XXcelerate garnered the support of Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who said via the news release that the state &#8220;cannot achieve its fullest potential to increase high-skill, high-wage jobs without extending equal opportunities to capital for women entrepreneurs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Fund aims to support women founders who are striving for venture capital, bank loans or profitability and financial independence. XXcelerate is creating a $3 million to $5 million pool of capital to help founders reach these goals, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/portland\/news\/2017\/01\/24\/new-loan-fund-to-invest-in-women-led-companies.html?ana=RSS%26s%3Darticle_search&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">according to the Portland Business Journal<\/a>. Along with potential funding, XXcelerate startup founders will benefit from year-long curriculum that includes guidance on finance, marketing, growth, branding, capitalization and more.<\/p>\n<p>The Fund&#8217;s founding board includes Klemm, as well as\u00a0Judith M. Hutchison, the Fund&#8217;s lending director, and entrepreneurs Paige Hendrix Buckner, Genevieve LeMarchal, Astrid Scholz and Mara Zepeda. Jill Nelson, founder and CEO of Ruby Receptionists, is the fund\u2019s Education and Mentorship Advisor.<\/p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xxceleratefund.com\/\">XXcelerate&#8217;s website <\/a>to learn more about their leadership, solution as well as how to apply.
