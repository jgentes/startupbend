Bend-based <a href=\"http:\/\/founderspad.com\/\">FoundersPad<\/a> announced the closing of a new fund, which will complement its revamped mentorship program.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The early-stage fund expects to invest between $25,000 and $75,000 per startups, funding between four and six startups each year. The FoundersPad team isn&#8217;t taking applications, but plans to find startups that have already gained some early customer traction, have a balanced founders team, haven&#8217;t taken on other professional capital and are primed for growth.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\u201cLaunching this new fund to complement our deep mentorship approach lets FoundersPad help our portfolio companies in a much more effective way,\u201d says Jason Moyer, the FoundersPad fund manager, in a news release. \u201cMost early stage companies need expertise and capital, typically in that order, and FoundersPad is strongly positioned to provide both.\u201d<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>More from the release:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>FoundersPad\u2019s unique model delivers extensive hands-on support to each portfolio company with a carefully curated team of relevant mentors who are committed to de-risk and grow their business.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\u201cBeing a Founder is often a long, brutal and lonely journey. It\u2019s survival of the fittest at its very best, where mistakes can be deadly,\u201d said FoundersPad Principal, Chris Capdevila. \u201cUnlike many venture funds that promise support for their portfolio companies and repeatedly fail to deliver, we provide founders an unfair advantage on their journey with intense mentoring from successful founders who have walked in their shoes and the right amount of capital at the right time.\u201d<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div>Bend startups Amplion, CrowdStreet and Droplr are all products of FoundersPad. The early-stage fund&#8217;s principals also include Dino Vendetti and Matt Abrams, general partner and investment partner as Seven Peaks Ventures, respectively.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>FounderPad&#8217;s goal is to help startups mature to the point where they&#8217;re eligible for further funding, from VCs such as Seven Peaks and beyond. Congrats FP team.
