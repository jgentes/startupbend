I knew that I loved talking to startup founders, hearing their ideas and absorbing some of their seemingly boundless energy. And I hoped there\u2019d be enough of them to reach my goal of 50.<\/p>\n<p>Now nine months and 23 startups into the project, I\u2019m happy to report: There\u2019s a lot going on here. From indoor, organic farming operations and B2B SaaS companies to makers of collapsible water bottles and low-sugar snack bars, Bend has a lively startup scene that only seems to be growing.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s five takeaways from our (still-in-progress) #50startups project:<\/p>\n<h2>1. There\u2019s more here than you think<\/h2>\n<p>When I started this project, I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find 50 startups to write about. Now I\u2019m worried about how to choose between the various startups that are here. I don\u2019t think this is a happy accident. The efforts that many here have put into to building out the entrepreneurial infrastructure are paying off. And while we are in the beginning stages, startup founders can find the basics of what they need to be successful in Bend including expert resources and services, sources of investment and a defined path for how to obtain it, and other experienced entrepreneurs. Consequently founding a tech or other type of startup here instead of in a major metropolis no longer seems like such a crazy idea. It\u2019s not only possible, but to many people, preferable.<\/p>\n<h2>2. There\u2019s more here than tech<\/h2>\n<p>If our local startups were an investment portfolio, then I think we\u2019d be considered well-diversified. There\u2019s no doubt that tech startups garner a lot of attention from media, investors and (ahem) bloggers. But Bend is also home to new businesses in several other markets. Among our first #50startups, half are B2B or B2C tech companies and the other half hail from a variety of industries including outdoor gear, food products and medical technology. We\u2019re big fans of the Bend Outdoor Worx accelerator, the burgeoning biotech cluster and the food and beverage manufacturers springing up. There\u2019s lots of room in this entrepreneurial pool. Hop in!<\/p>\n<h2>3. There\u2019s a huge need for talent<\/h2>\n<p>Most of the two dozen startups interviewed for #50startups are hiring in some capacity. Not surprisingly, there\u2019s a big demand for technical talent from both startups and existing tech companies such as Navis. Blog posts about jobs are often our most well-read posts, and we\u2019ve launched a <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/jobs\">free jobs board <\/a>to help further get the word out about open tech\/startup jobs in Central Oregon.<\/p>\n<h2>4. The dogs are secretly in charge<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.bendbroadband.com\/business\/files\/2015\/04\/Sage-startupdog.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1480 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.bendbroadband.com\/business\/files\/2015\/04\/Sage-startupdog-300x244.jpg\" alt=\"Sage startupdog\" width=\"300\" height=\"244\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Like everyone else here, Bend startup founders love their dogs. Startup offices are filled with dogs of all sorts, some of them lounging around and some them filling in as developers. Kidding! (Obviously only cats could do that.) We have a side project to #50startups called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbendtech.com%2F&amp;ei=Z4FKVa-2DNG6ogTJl4DADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6PWrtu7u7el9B4kf0H5ZtnviO9A&amp;sig2=24zwZL7BssZosGzWrmpJwA&amp;bvm=bv.92291466,d.cGU\">#dogsofstartups<\/a>, where we post pics of the pooches that support our local startup founders and may or may not secretly be running the whole show.<\/p>\n<h2>5. People are here on purpose<\/h2>\n<p>By and large, Bend startup founders are here by choice. They are aware that this is not San Francisco or Seattle or even Portland. Many have come from bigger places, where they\u2019ve founded other businesses or worked for bigger organizations. They see this as a place of opportunity: there\u2019s access to (many) big city resources without the big city hassle. Are there gaps? Absolutely. Remember, this isn\u2019t San Francisco, Seattle or even Portland. But there\u2019s also creative solutions and \u2014 as comes with this hearty group \u2014 a lot of optimism.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited to see what our #50startups pull off and the economic benefits their efforts will bring this awesome place we call home. We\u2019ll continue to post updates on the companies we\u2019re following, and introduce you to new ones nearly every week.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a title=\"BendBroadband Business\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bendbroadband.com\/business\" target=\"_blank\">BendBroadband Business<\/a> is proud to sponsor the #50startups project.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hold onto your heads, because we&#8217;re about to get real meta: I wrote a blog post for BendBroadband Business blog [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[61],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32407"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32407"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32407\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32409,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32407\/revisions\/32409"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32407"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32407"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32407"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
