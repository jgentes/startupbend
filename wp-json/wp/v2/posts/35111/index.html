Between equity investments, cash awards and revenue-financing, the region\u2019s largest angel conference doled out $1.65 million in funds after one-and-a-half days of founder pitches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And big the checks go to \u2026 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The event\u2019s big winner was Bend-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leadmethod.com\">LeadMethod<\/a>, a tech company that makes channel revenue optimization software. The company won the conference\u2019s growth stage award, a $110,000-plus investment from the BVC LLC, as well as a $175,000 investment from Cascade Angels, $50,000 from Portland Seed Fund and $150,000 in revenue financing from Business Oregon. Founder Justin Johnson hammered home the progress his team has made over the past three years, and the big opportunity ahead\u2014and investors agreed. For a few reasons, this was an especially special win. More on that in a moment.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35119\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35119\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35119\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2684-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2684-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2684-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2684-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35119\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The LeadMethod team celebrates after BVC 2017.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Tigard-based <a href=\"https:\/\/handful.com\/collections\/bras?gclid=CjwKCAjw4KvPBRBeEiwAIqCB-QAMWWwJwm1VjCvlEQx2qJsJAxEnF5OKVnebhmah8nR-dhrE9CBv0xoCeGwQAvD_BwE\">Handful <\/a>also had a great day with a great outcome. Founder Jennifer Ferguson danced onto the growth stage to Pink (the music was a fun addition to the program) and wowed the crowd with her energetic pitch for Handful, a rising brand of awesome bras \u2013 I now own one and you should too &#8212; and athleisure wear. Heads up: You can use the code BVC15 to get a discount on the company\u2019s site through the end of the month. Handful aims for a market of Millennials and breast cancer survivors, which includes many key people on their team.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35113\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35113\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35113\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2671-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2671-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2671-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2671-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35113\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Handful team smiling after their second big check of the day.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>During the conference, panelists questioned whether this was a disparate market, and Jennifer noted that unfortunately it\u2019s not: Most Millennials know a breast cancer survivor and some are already survivors themselves. Handful earned a $250,000 investment in a combined Elevate Capital, Credo and TiE Oregon and a $100,000-plus investment from the BVC LLC Fund.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social impact and early stage <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The social impact track came roaring back for its second year, and the group of four founders presenting didn\u2019t disappoint. Social impact companies succeed by \u201cdoing good and doing well,\u201d as moderator Julie Harrelson noted, whether that\u2019s creating earth-friendly, alternative energy sources or reducing water pollution via water-free textile fabric finishes. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenthemeint.com\/\">Portland-based Green Theme International <\/a>does the latter, and earned a $110,000-plus investment from the BVC Social Impact Fund.<\/p>\n<p>In the early stage, competition was fierce. The presenters brought their A-game on stage to pitch startups ranging from a group travel and adventure planning app to instant coffee subscriptions to outdoorsy gear. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bladerunnerenergy.com\/\">BladeRunner Energy<\/a> won the popular audience vote and the $17,500 BendBroadband Business Early Stage cash award. BladeRunner Energy\u00a0creates a micro-hydro technology based on biomimicry that generates renewable energy from the flow of water.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35114\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35114\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35114\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2589-e1508644659564-500x447.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2589-e1508644659564-500x447.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2589-e1508644659564-768x687.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2589-e1508644659564-1024x916.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moriel w\/ BladeRunner, explains the tech to the crowd.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Cofounder Moriel Arango explained the benefit that the technology could offer rural and developing communities.

Like moms do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beaming in Brad Feld<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The event\u2019s keynote speaker Brad Feld, founder of TechStars and the Foundry Group in Boulder, offered some sage advice for how smaller places can build up their startup communities. The BVC Skyped him in from Colorado, and the resulting conversation was a great one, especially if you\u2019re interested in developing startups outside of the usual places.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35115\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35115\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35115\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2600-e1508644738279-500x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2600-e1508644738279-500x354.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2600-e1508644738279-768x544.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2600-e1508644738279-1024x725.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35115\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Will the wonders of the Internet ever cease?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Feld noted the importance of flat networks \u2013 ones in which people ignore hierarchy \u2013 and inclusive environments, in which lots of people have a voice. He said that often, smaller places aren\u2019t necessarily lacking in capital (though it may not yet be activated) or great ideas from motivated entrepreneurs. His direct take: \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense.\u201d Big cities aren\u2019t the only places where funds and ideas dwell and percolate. Indeed, the trick\u2014actually the goal\u2014is creating and cultivating a community that promotes connection between funding and ideas, and then accelerates the transformation of these ideas into businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hey, I know that guy \u2026 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On a personal note, this year\u2019s Bend Venture Conference was especially meaningful as I happen to know the CEO and founder of LeadMethod, mostly because we\u2019re married. So, of course, it\u2019s delightful to see Justin and his team do well, and it warms my heart because I know how hard they work every day.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35116\" style=\"width: 449px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35116\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2690-e1508644893180-449x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2690-e1508644893180-449x500.jpg 449w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2690-e1508644893180-768x855.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2690-e1508644893180-919x1024.jpg 919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Erm. Will these fit in an ATM?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There are certainly challenges to building businesses anywhere, and there are indeed some struggles unique to being outside a major tech or urban hub. It was heartening to listen to Brad Feld talk about some of the ingredients for a vibrant startup community, from activated local angels to startup events to that irreverence of hierarchy (which can make things move faster on many fronts), and know that many of those are already in our pot, simmering away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Super-secret sauce<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Then Bend offers something else as well: A supportive community that wants people do well. This cannot be underestimated, and IMHO can even serve as a competitive advantage. What\u2019s that look like? It looks like a new entrepreneur freezing on stage at the unConference last Tuesday and numerous people in the audience yelling out \u201cWe love you\u201d and \u201cYou got this\u201d before asking questions to help.<\/p>\n<p>It looks like Julie Harrelson, Cascade Angels CEO and fund manager, presenting a new investment in LeadMethod at BVC with lots of feeling, thanking not just LeadMethod, but also Oregon entrepreneurs, investors, and the entire community for its hard work. Consider that a mere four years ago, that organization didn\u2019t exist, and now it\u2019s become an invaluable resource.<\/p>\n<p>It looks like a local founder asking a local VC partner for feedback, and getting an introduction and conversation a few hours later. It looks these blog readers filling up a truck full of supplies for Sonoma fire victims in one day to support the BendTECH coworking space manager, who comes from there. It looks like countless introductions, emails and coffee meetings that Bend people still make time for\u2014even with strangers. It looks like founders talking about their failures and then talking about the need to talk about what\u2019s hard. It looks like investors who roll up their sleeves and get into all of this stuff, because they want to help.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35117\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35117\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35117\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2495-e1508645107803-500x358.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2495-e1508645107803-500x358.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2495-e1508645107803-768x551.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2495-e1508645107803-1024x734.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35117\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A day of donations for Sonoma from BendTECH coworkers.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That\u2019s honestly just what I\u2019ve seen this week.

And while no one knows for certain what the future holds for any one startup or Bend as a whole, as long as we maintain this ingredient, we\u2019ll be still #winning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The end of this year\u2019s Bend Venture Conference looked a lot like last year\u2014lots of big checks, surprises, cheers and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":35119,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7,11,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35111"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=35111"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35111\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":35121,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35111\/revisions\/35121"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/35119"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=35111"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=35111"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=35111"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
