Droplr Debuts Screenbot App for Slack"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to send a screenshot via Slack, you&#8217;re gonna like this next development. Droplr, based in Bend and <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-droplr-banks-on-a-freemium-model\/\">one of our #50startups<\/a>, announced that it&#8217;s launching a new app today that &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/screenbot.io\/home\/\">gives Slack super powers<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Called Screenbot, this official Slack integration allows users to send screenshots, screencasts and annotations via Slack with a simple slash command, eliminating the previously required, multi-step process.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c &#8230; Screenbot eliminates confusion and enables users to get their point across efficiently while increasing productivity,\u201d says\u00a0Levi Nunnink, CTO and founder of Droplr.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>According to the company&#8217;s news release, the <a href=\"http:\/\/droplr.com\/\">Droplr<\/a> folks got the idea for Screenbot after they realized how many times a day they were sharing screenshots and annotations on Slack. So in total startup fashion, they decided to build a solution.<\/p>\n<p>Now after four months of beta testing and 22 iterations, the cake is baked. And you <a href=\"http:\/\/screenbot.io\/home\/\">can try it for free here<\/a>. A pro upgrade of Screenbot is available for $5.00\/month, which includes unlimited sharing, custom themes and domains, and secure privacy settings for sensitive data.<\/p>\n<p>Droplr has targeted creatives &#8212; at ad agencies and in house creative departments &#8212; as the prime market for its original easy file sharing service. The company now claims 500,000 users, with 250 people signing up each day.\u00a0The Screenbot app gives them, and a broader Slack audience, another tool aimed at making workplace communication easier.<\/p>\n<p>The company was founded in 2009 as a solution to another problem, a dearth of simple ways to email large files. The startup has since raised more than $850,000 from investors including Bend-based Seven Peaks Ventures and Cascade Angels.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/portland\/blog\/techflash\/2015\/10\/bend-file-sharing-startup-taps-an-iron-man-as-its.html\">Droplr hired a new CEO<\/a>, Gray Skinner, who is a\u00a0Portland Incubator Experiment alum, former chief operating officer of Executive Stamina and a professional triathlete. We&#8217;re hoping to catch up with him soon. If we can &#8230; he probably runs fast &#8230; this joke is trying too hard &#8230; point being: Stay tuned.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to send a screenshot via Slack, you&#8217;re gonna like this next development.
