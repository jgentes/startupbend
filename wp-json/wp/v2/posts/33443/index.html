Then join us for StartupBend&#8217;s first-ever <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/events\/dnd\/\">Demos and Drinks night<\/a>, sponsored by <a href=\"https:\/\/bendbroadband.com\/business\/\">BendBroadband Business<\/a>, starting at 7 p.m. Feb. 24.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to give you an insiders&#8217; look at the software and hardware being created by some of our most interesting tech startups. We&#8217;ll dig into the technology and offer the chance to ask questions. We&#8217;ll also hang out and drink beer and give away a few presents. Best night ever? Probably.<\/p>\n<p>This month we&#8217;re featuring the founders of CodePen and Garmin\/Pulsed Light (Garmin acquired this Bend startup last month).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-codepen-creates-community-for-front-end-developers\/\">CodePen<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Co-founder Tim Sabat will show off the benefits of the robust online community and code editor that CodePen provides to hundreds of thousands front-end developers all over the world. More from <a href=\"http:\/\/codepen.io\/\">their site<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Need to build a reduced test case to demonstrate and figure out a bug? CodePen is great for that. Want to show off your latest creation and get feedback from your peers? CodePen is great for that. Want to find examples of a particular design pattern for your project? CodePen is great for that.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/codepen.io\/pro\/\">CodePen PRO<\/a> takes things further with features like Collab Mode which allows you to pair program in real time and Professor Mode for allowing a group of students to follow you as you teach code and chat with each other.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Garmin (formerly <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50-startups-pulsedlight-helps-drones-fly-safely\/\">PulsedLight<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Bob Lewis, co-founder of PulsedLight. The startup creates\u00a0small, low-cost sensors that make high performance distance measurements. Its flagship product,\u00a0LIDAR-Lite is an optical sensor that does just that. In Lewis&#8217; and co-founder Dennis Corey&#8217;s words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our system is a hybrid between standard \u201ctime of flight\u201d sensors, and technologies used in radar. In contrast to\u00a0conventional systems, we use software for signal processing instead of relying solely on hardware.\u00a0The LIDAR-Lite sends out a series of up to 255 pulses every second and each pulse is\u00a0encoded with a random code, in essence a fingerprint. We can then find that signal in the noise to produce accurate measurements from a 0 to 50 meter range. A lot of other rangefinders don\u2019t work at close range because they\u00a0have to wait for signal return. LIDAR-Lite and our other products\u00a0in the pipeline can\u00a0transmit and receive at the same time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Does that whet your appetite for some serious geeking out? <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/cowork\/\">BendTECH <\/a>and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the1001bend.com\/\">the 1001 Tech Center<\/a> are graciously hosting us.
