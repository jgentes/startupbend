They won. Matt Smith, the company&#8217;s founder, snagged the popular vote for his early-stage startup, a social app that helps plan group adventures.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People were really excited about the idea, and couldn&#8217;t believe that it didn&#8217;t exist,&#8221; Smith says. &#8220;The most common response we got was &#8216;I&#8217;m planning three trips and I need this right now.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34754\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34754\" style=\"width: 625px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34754 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2237-1-e1497472315657-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"833\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2237-1-e1497472315657-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2237-1-e1497472315657-375x500.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Matt Smith, on the right, getting ready to pitch &#8212; and win. Boom!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tribepilot.com\/\">Tribe Pilot<\/a> was initially selected from more than 30 companies to compete in what OUTFOUND calls its venture stage, essentially concept-stage startups. Matt narrowly squeaked by his two presenting competitors to win a bottle of <em>Oregon bourbon, <\/em>and of course the glory of winning.<\/p>\n<p>Second place went to <a href=\"https:\/\/animosa.co\/go-with-your-flow-2\">Animosa<\/a>, a startup that makes a menstrual disposal kit for women adventuring in the outdoors and away from restrooms. Third place was Cirque Series, a company that promotes maximum altitude gain running events.<\/p>\n<p>The OUTFOUND Festival also included a growth-stage competition, and both tracks were coordinated by Bend Outdoor Worx. The winner of the growth stage competition received a fast tracked application to the <a href=\"http:\/\/bendoutdoorworx.com\/venture-out\/\">Venture Out Festival<\/a>, which is this October in Bend. (If you didn&#8217;t go last year, you need to go this year. So many fun startups. So many great people. An awesome night).<\/p>\n<p>For Matt, the win is further confirmation that his app has legs. He&#8217;s deep in development of the product right now, with a beta launch scheduled for August, and an official launch planned in September. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got new features coming online each week,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>At its core, Tribe Pilot is a social app that helps you plan trips and adventures with numerous people. The idea is to eliminate the 127-email chain, and provide a place to headquarter your trip planning and everything associated with it, from to-do lists to meal planning to photos.<\/p>\n<p>As someone who has planned a 65-person reunion, many group camping weekends and the occasional girls getaway (Wine anyone? I&#8217;m already driving there. Not even sure where. Just going) this product has my attention. Matt says the feature list currently includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polls for choosing dates<\/li>\n<li>Group and personal packing and to-do lists<\/li>\n<li>Meal plan creation<\/li>\n<li>Maps<\/li>\n<li>Group photo share<\/li>\n<li>Mobile money integration, so you can divvy up costs<\/li>\n<li>A group chat within the app<\/li>\n<li>A social aspect that lets you share your trips with others in your network.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Matt&#8217;s currently on the hunt for a business development person who can spearhead some B2B partnerships. He&#8217;s also headed to Outdoor Retailer next month to spread the word about Tribe Pilot. Congrats to Tribe Pilot on its first win &#8212; and we have a feeling you&#8217;ll be hearing lots more about this startup in the months to come.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember when we reported that new Bend startup Tribe Pilot had been selected as one of three early stage companies [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":34754,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11,15,63,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34752"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34752"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34752\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":34755,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34752\/revisions\/34755"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34754"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34752"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34752"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=34752"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
