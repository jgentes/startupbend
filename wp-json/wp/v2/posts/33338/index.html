I&#8217;m planning to organize at least four events to better serve and connect our startup community. I&#8217;d like to create an organized way for startup founders and employees to give back to Bend via volunteer efforts (more on that to come). I&#8217;d like to finish our #50startups project &#8212; just a handful to go. And I&#8217;d like to hire someone to help us write more content. That&#8217;s right, this lil&#8217; ol&#8217; blog is growing.<\/p>\n<p>Now do you feel inspired? I do. The startup community here is an awesome, hard-working, smart and creative force. And it gets bigger and stronger every year. I really want to make a Star Wars reference here, but I&#8217;m not cool enough to think of one. At any rate, welcome to 2016.
