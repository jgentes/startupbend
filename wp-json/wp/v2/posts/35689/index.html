BendTECH Presents the 9th Annual unConference Pitchfest w\/ More Cash Prizes and More Fun!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/bendtechevents\/bendtech-unconference\/\">BendTECH unConference<\/a> is back for its 9th year, bigger and better than ever. The unConference, <strong>scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 16th<\/strong>, is a fun-loving, crowd-pleasing, startup-celebrating pitch fest. Entrepreneurs line up to snag one of the first-come, first-serve pitch spots and then compete on stage to win cash awards. Winners are determined by audience vote.<\/p>\n<p>Last year was the first that the unConference offered cash prizes. This year, thanks to the awesome sponsors, we&#8217;re offering A. more prizes, and B. bigger ones. The idea is to provide some fuel to help people with a spark an idea take the next meaningful step.<\/p>\n<p>The competition is open to everyone including students, people in town for the Bend Venture Conference, those who have pitched other places and those who have are putting their startup idea out there for the first time. There are very few rules: All ideas and founders are welcome. We just ask that entrepreneurs on stage and people in crowd be supportive, be constructive, and have fun.<\/p>\n<p>The awards, determined by audience vote, are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First place: <\/strong>$2,500 and a BendTECH coworking membership.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Second place:<\/strong> $1,000 and a BendTECH coworking membership.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Third place: <\/strong>$500 and a BendTECH coworking membership.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The event is free, and in our 1,000% biased opinion, quite fun. Every attendee gets a free beer ticket. We&#8217;ll be raffling off an Apple Watch to those who stick around for the vote. And there&#8217;s cowbells so that you can show your support for ideas that you think have legs and founders who need a little love.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35697 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/UnConference2018-01-356x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"356\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/UnConference2018-01-356x500.png 356w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/UnConference2018-01-768x1077.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/UnConference2018-01-730x1024.png 730w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Other things:<\/strong> In keeping with the &#8220;un,&#8221; BendTECH doesn&#8217;t take applications or reserve pitch spots. For the past few years, people have been showing up a bit early &#8212; sometimes an hour or two &#8212; to stand in line and secure a spot. We&#8217;ll aim for 15 to 18 spots, and the line for snagging one will be clearly marked. Once the spots are filled, they&#8217;re filled.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if you want to win, some early campaigning to get your friends and family there to vote certainly helps and is encouraged. The voting happens after all the pitches, and the winners are announced right then.<\/p>\n<p>This event is a labor of love from BendTECH Coworking staff, volunteers and super amazing sponsors.
