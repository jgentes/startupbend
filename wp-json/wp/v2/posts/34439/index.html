It&#8217;s a great chance to meet other professionals working in town, plus you can learn more about G5 from the company&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer Chris Eckert. There&#8217;s also beer, wine and non-alcoholic beverages.<\/p>\n<p>More info from our <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/event\/young-professionals-networking-event-at-g5\/?instance_id=96597\">events page<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>G5 is the leading digital marketing provider in the real estate sector delivering higher marketing ROI. This mission has led to a business built on making customers happy with an average 98% customer retention rate, 240 employees, and five consecutive years on Deloitte\u2019s list of North America\u2019s fastest growing technology companies. G5 was also named to OUTSIDE\u2019s \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d 2016 edition, for the third consecutive year and also awarded the Bend Chamber\u2019s SAGE Business Award \u201cHealthy Workplace of the Year\u201d in 2016. Additionally, G5 has been recognized as one of Oregon\u2019s best 100 Companies to work for, ranked on the Inc. 500 list, and one of the top 10 healthiest employers of Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>Management at G5 is hands-off, as the company believes in empowering employees to own their work. Managers communicate the issues clients have, but coming up with suitable and creative solutions is done by the staff actually producing the work. This flexible approach makes for a workplace that employees enjoy coming back to. Plus, it doesn\u2019t hurt that you can bring you dog into the office! We even have a \u201cDogs of G5\u201d team page on our website.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to G5 that the workplace is a warm, welcoming environment \u2013 with employees who spread energy and optimism. To encourage this mentality, the company really lives the values. When G5 staff become consciously aware of the values \u2013 when they make the connections to the feelings that they generate \u2013 and understand what behaviors reinforce them, employees can experience that \u201ceureka\u201d moment of striking gold. Identifying what\u2019s deeply important is one thing \u2013 living it is another.<\/p>\n<p>The Young Professionals Network (YPN) is a conduit for young emerging professionals, ages 21-40, to access unique and valuable experiences. We\u2019re engaging, educating and empowering young professionals to become the future leaders of business in the region.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The event costs $5 for Bend Chamber members and $10 for general admission if you pre-register.
