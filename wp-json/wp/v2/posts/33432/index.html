I\u2019m glad I did. The Bend-based VC firm has gone through quite the growth spurt over the past year from moving into new offices to growing its partner network to more than doubling the number of companies in its portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the investments. <a href=\"http:\/\/sevenpeaksventures.com\/\">Seven Peaks <\/a>currently has 18 companies in its portfolio, up from eight in 2014. Founded three years ago, many of the firm\u2019s first investments were in Bend startups &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-droplr-banks-on-a-freemium-model\/\">Droplr<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/amplion-closes-1-million-seed-round\/\">Amplion<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-manzama-pushes-into-profitability\/\">Manzama<\/a> and Crowdstreet &#8212; bringing some crucial early stage capital to what was essentially a funding high desert.<\/p>\n<p>However, as the VC firm has added partners and areas of expertise it\u2019s also expanded its reach, investing in Portland companies such as Cozy, CrowdSupply, and Opal as well as startups in the Bay Area, Boulder and Salt Lake City. Oregon startups currently account for just over half of the firm\u2019s investments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had unique access to companies that are based here in Oregon, where we\u2019ve seen a real need for sophisticated, early stage, institutional investing,\u201d says Investment Partner Corey Schmid. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve added partners and we\u2019re expanding to be a bridge to VC communities all over the West.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33434\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33434\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CoreySchmid-6594-e1454353322904-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Corey Schmid, investment partner with Seven Peaks. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CoreySchmid-6594-e1454353322904-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/CoreySchmid-6594-e1454353322904-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Corey Schmid, investment partner with Seven Peaks.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Still the firm\u2019s work in Oregon remains as important as ever. Even with all the activity across the state, Investment Partner Steve Barham adds that the majority of funding provided to Oregon startups still comes from outside the state. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to fill that gap,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Seven Peaks has also honed its investment focus to digital healthcare (Bright.md, Enlitic), disruptive consumer\/marketplace platforms (CrowdStreet) and data driven enterprise software (Slam Data, Client Success) companies.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33435\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33435\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Steve-Headshot-12-e1454353371350-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Barham, investment partner with Seven Peaks. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Steve-Headshot-12-e1454353371350-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Steve-Headshot-12-e1454353371350-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Steve Barham, investment partner with Seven Peaks.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>And the firm has worked to expand its network of VC partners, which can help it build a solid pipeline of prospects and referrals. \u201cIf a company doesn\u2019t fit our criteria for investment or focus, we can refer it to one of our syndicate partners that we trust and they do the same,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can also partner on funding rounds and get attention for our portfolio companies with other potential investors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, moved into its new digs at the 1001 Tech Center. Not only do their investment partners work out of the space, but they also have executives from a couple of their portfolio companies, including the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/portland\/blog\/techflash\/2015\/10\/bend-file-sharing-startup-taps-an-iron-man-as-its.html\">new CEO of Droplr<\/a>, Gray Skinner, and co-founder of Crowdstreet, Darren Powderly.<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s up for 2016? Basically more. More investments. More syndicate partners. And more support for Oregon startups.\u00a0\u201cWe want to continue to help put Oregon startups on the map,\u201d Barham says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been meaning to catch up with Seven Peaks Ventures for a while, and I finally had the chance.
