It was a banner year with over 90 impressive applicants. We continue to attract some of the most innovative companies in the west to compete for these investments. And at the same time, there\u2019s room for companies of all stages to compete within our three categories,\u201d said Brian Vierra, EDCO\u2019s Venture Catalyst.<\/p>\n<p>Companies in the Social Impact Competition historically compete for investments ranging from $50,000-$100,000. BendBroadband Business returns to sponsor the Early Stage Competition with a $17,500 cash grant, while Growth Stage Competition finalists could collect an investment of $250,000 or more. The 2017 BVC will feature impressive panelists and keynote speakers from across the country representing angel investors, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, to be announced at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>Jason Moyer, Fund Manager for the 2017 BVC, LLC said, \u201cDuring the past several years, BVC has matured from a local angel event, to one of the more valuable conferences in the country.\u00a0 We\u2019re attracting some of the region\u2019s most promising early-stage ventures, along with numerous professionally managed investment funds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe inaugural year of the Social Impact Fund was wildly successful and exceeded all expectations,\u201d noted Ryan Andrews, Fund Manager for the 2017 BVC Social Impact Fund. \u201cWe were the very first fund to invest in two companies, OpConnect and Hemex Health, which have both gone on to raise significant additional investment and find market traction. This is a huge accomplishment for any fund and our goal for this year is to continue on that path.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Want to do it? Do it. How?
