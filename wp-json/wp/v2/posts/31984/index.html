If your business was a vehicle, would it be an old-fashioned wagon, speed boat or an adorable scooter? The questions may seem far-fetched, but answer a dozen of them using PrestoBox\u2019s Brand Genie tool and you\u2019ll end up with a brand personality, business logo, business card and even website to call your own.<\/p>\n<p>Bend-native Elicia Putnam founded PrestoBox as the world\u2019s first automated branding agency. She was looking for a way to streamline the lengthy and costly branding process she guided the clients of her advertising agency through, and make it more accessible for small businesses. BendTECH interviewed Putnam to learn more about PrestoBox, its budding partnership with Staples and how it plans to bring branding to the entrepreneurial masses.<\/p>\n<p>Startup: <a href=\"https:\/\/prestobox.com\/\">PrestoBox<\/a><br \/>\nStarted: Spring 2012<br \/>\nFounders: Elicia Putnam, Sara Conte, Michael Verdine and Clay Givens<br \/>\nHeadquarters: Bend and Portland<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you describe PrestoBox? <\/strong>It\u2019s the world\u2019s first automated branding agency. We\u2019re geared toward small business owners who value design, but can\u2019t afford an agency or even a freelancer to help them create a brand.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31985\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31985\" style=\"width: 389px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/elicia-photo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31985\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/elicia-photo-389x500.jpg\" alt=\"Elicia Putnam, Founder and CEO of PrestoBox.\" width=\"389\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/elicia-photo-389x500.jpg 389w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/elicia-photo.jpg 785w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31985\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Elicia Putnam, Founder and CEO of PrestoBox.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How does it work? <\/strong>It\u2019s similar to an agency process in that we provide a guiding hand to help you. That\u2019s the soon-to-be patented Brand Genie, which we developed based on my 12 years of branding experience. It poses a range of questions for small business owners. For example, we ask what texture is your business, what water scene describes your business and what celebrity best fits your business. Based on your answers, the Brand Genie recommends one of 17 brand personalities from Town Square to Place of Zen. Based on your brand personality, the tool offers you a selection of logos (there\u2019s more than 50,000 available) colors and a website.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31987\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31987\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-5-e1423068529617.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31987\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-5-e1423068529617-500x251.png\" alt=\"One of PrestoBox's 77 brand personalities. \" width=\"500\" height=\"251\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-5-e1423068529617-500x251.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-5-e1423068529617-1024x514.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Screenshot-5-e1423068529617.png 1249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31987\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of PrestoBox&#8217;s 17 brand personalities.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the questions? <\/strong>Everyone knows the tangible stuff like your customer demographics, market size, etc. But I wanted a way to find out the intangibles, such as a company\u2019s aesthetic preferences.

Last year we connected with Staples to run a three-week pilot project at their Renton and Portland stores. Their top executive team had been brainstorming on how to sell more printed products and knew an automated branding tool would help them. So they reached out to us. During the pilot project, we walked customers through our automated branding process. The two stores doubled their printed product sales while we\u00a0 were there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So does your revenue come from partnerships or individuals? <\/strong>Both, though this is really a partnership play. We did generate about $80,000 over 18 months directly from customers, however for efficiency we\u2019re aiming to develop strategic partnerships that can help quickly spread the word about PrestoBox.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you fundraising?\u00a0<\/strong>Up until now we\u2019ve been mostly bootstrapped, thanks to a $140,000 investment from our co-founding group and a $100,000 outside angel investment. We\u2019re just about to open a small convertible note, and we\u2019ll likely look for a larger Series A round in the next year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next for PrestoBox? <\/strong>Last year was really about proving the concept. I think this year will be our breakout year. We\u2019re finalizing our new logo builder and we should have more than 100,000 options available over the next three months. We\u2019re prepping a dashboard that will let you compare options, swap fonts and save your brand. And we\u2019re studying analytics and focusing on the user experience.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your small business was a pair of shoes, would it be more like hiking boots, loafers or pumps?
