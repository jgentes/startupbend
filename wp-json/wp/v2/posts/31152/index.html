(More that program to come).<\/p>\n<p>Cairn is sending out more of its boxes stuffed with outdoor recreation goodies each month.\u00a0A monthly subscription is $25 with a box featuring products from four categories: gear, apparel, skin care, and food and energy. Last month&#8217;s box included an energy gel and bar, carabiners and a LifeStraw, which filters water from any source.<\/p>\n<p>Little isn&#8217;t shy about featuring local companies.\u00a0In fact, he connected with Redmond-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strawpropellergourmetfoods.com\/product\">Straw Propeller<\/a>, maker of oatmeal and muesli cups, shortly after PubTalk (and because of PubTalk, he says). Cairn&#8217;s May boxes included 200 Straw Propeller oatmeal cups sent to subscribers in 40 different states.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are continuing to grow each month, with very positive feedback from both our subscribers and the brands we&#8217;re partnering with,&#8221; Little says. &#8220;They not only get exposure to new potential customers, but get data back on how well their product is received in the marketplace.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company was also recently<a href=\"http:\/\/mywindowco.com\/monthly-outdoor-products-sent-straight-door\/\"> featured on KBNZ&#8217;s My Window<\/a>\u00a0program.
