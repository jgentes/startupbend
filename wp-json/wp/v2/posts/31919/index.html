Because this next #50startup company might just blow your mind. Bend-based Kidrunner is aiming to change how people run (and ski and bike and explore) with their kids with its hands-free, pull-style running stroller.<\/p>\n<p>This past year was a breakout one for the company. Founded by Will Warne, Andre Cardec and Mauricio Mejia in 2011, Kidrunner earned a spot on the concept stage at the Bend Venture Conference. Elite runner Max King, the company\u2019s first athlete-ambassador, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JbG3-s6gMdU\"><em>won<\/em> a 10K pulling his daughter in a Kidrunner<\/a>. And the company partnered with Bend-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.compositeapproach.com\/\">Composite Approach<\/a> to help bring this not-stroller to market by summer. BendTECH recently talked with Warne to learn more about how he came up with the idea and when you can buy one.<\/p>\n<p>Startup: <a href=\"http:\/\/kidrunners.com\/\">Kidrunner<\/a><br \/>\nStarted: 2011<br \/>\nFounders: Will Warne; Andre Cardec; Mauricio Mejia<br \/>\nHeadquarters: Bend<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31922\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31922\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/V5A.121.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-31922\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/V5A.121-250x250.png\" alt=\"Kidrunner Version 5. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/V5A.121-250x250.png 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/V5A.121-500x500.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/V5A.121-600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31922\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kidrunner Version 5.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>What is a Kidrunner? <\/strong>It\u2019s a high-performance piece of hands-free, pull-style sports equipment that lets you run and explore with your kids. There\u2019s no more pushing. In fact, studies that show you can gain 30% more efficiency when you use your upper body to run. But parents have become accustomed to being inefficient because there haven\u2019t been options for running with your kids beyond what\u2019s basically a shopping cart.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea? <\/strong>Both my wife and I were running 20-plus miles a week after we got married. Then we had our daughter and the first time we took her out in the jogging stroller it was awful. I felt embarrassed by how awkward it was. So I started thinking of how it could be better &#8212; I drew up sketches, went to Home Depot and got a bunch of PVC pipe, plumbing parts and duct tape. My first prototype of the Kidrunner was this 10-foot long contraption. I waited until my wife (a pediatrician and Bend native) went to work, and then put my six-month-old daughter in it and ran down the street.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How\u2019d that go &#8230; <\/strong>There was a small crowd of my neighbors watching. The dads were clapping. I think some of the moms were almost crying in fear. But it worked. I proved the concept.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31923\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31923\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150120_150014-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31923\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150120_150014-1-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Will Warne, co-founder Kidrunner. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150120_150014-1-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20150120_150014-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Will Warne, co-founder Kidrunner.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s happening with Kidrunner now? <\/strong>We just partnered with Composite Approach, a Bend company that grew out of the local composite airplane industry. The whole Kidrunner solution is to have a lightweight, beautifully designed piece of sport equipment, like a mountain bike or ski, so we need to use composite materials. They\u2019re a perfect partner. We\u2019re also building out our ambassador program with Max (King) at the helm. He\u2019s run hundreds of miles with the Kidrunner, including winning the BigFoot 10k, and granted us a lot of credibility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next? <\/strong>We\u2019ve got a 90% go-to-market prototype, and we\u2019d like to have products for sale by this summer. The biggest question right now is how to finance the first orders, and how to commercialize the product. We\u2019d also like outfit about a dozen ambassadors with a Kidrunner, including two athletes who are training for the Olympics. We\u2019re contemplating exploring crowdfunding to help us do that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you currently fundraising? <\/strong>So far, we\u2019ve been self financed. I think we\u2019ll need about $500,000 to scale the production of Kidrunner. We\u2019ve had a lot of investor interest, especially after BVC. We\u2019ve also garnered some attention from retail partners. But we\u2019re still determining how we want to approach investment.<\/p>\n<p>More #50startups to come!
