The panelists will share information and answer questions about the latest threats and what you can do to protect your business.<\/p>\n<p>According to the COCC news release, PricewaterhouseCoopers quantified the cybersecurity problem: in 2014 companies and government agencies detected almost 43 million hacks, or roughly 117,000 a day. In addition, a\u00a0recent Microsoft study reports that consumer computers encounter twice the number of threats as compared to business computers, according to 2016 Trends in Cybersecurity. Microsoft reiterates that keeping all software up to date and installing all security patches are most important. Having antivirus software is not enough.<\/p>\n<p>According to Lewis Howell of Hueya, people often think it is their bank accounts that these cyber criminals are targeting. \u201cHowever, more and more it is about our identities,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial media has made us more connected than at any other time in history, but it has exposed us more. However, there are ways to mitigate even this threat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The cost of the forum is $59 a person.
