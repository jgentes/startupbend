It was a threat of a DDoS attack, complete with a ransom request.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was supposedly sent by a party who has done things like this in the past,\u201d Sabat said in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.codepen.io\/radio\/\">CodePen\u2019s new podcast <\/a>on the issue. \u201cIt said that \u2018we\u2019re going to attack your site in 5 days unless you send us 10 bitcoins, which was about $4,100.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The podcast dives more into what a DDoS attack is, but in the most basic description, the people making the threat direct so much traffic to your website that it goes down. They\u2019re in control of the traffic and you\u2019re at their mercy. The takeaway of the note CodePen received: If you want to stop this trouble, send the money.<\/p>\n<p>The response from the co-founders: Not today.<em> Not ever.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The trio of co-founders discussed on the podcast (btw, listening to this is a well-spent 28 minutes) how strongly they felt about not paying these criminals money. On a scale of\u00a01 to 10 of giving a fruit, co-founder Chris Coyier said he was \u201c10 of 10.\u201d Sabat adds that he\u2019d pay exponential amounts of more money not to pay the ransom. \u201cIf they\u2019re asking for $4,100, then I\u2019d pay $41,000 to fend off a DDoS attack,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>So instead of capitulating &#8212; which the founders discussed came with its own set of risks, including letting the note-senders know you have money and can access bitcoin &#8212; CodePen got to work. They used the five days to shore up their site, following instructions from AWS, which described the key components of solid DDoS defense.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32519\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32519\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32519\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/codepen-500x396.png\" alt=\"CodePen co-founders: Chris, Alex and Tim. \" width=\"500\" height=\"396\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CodePen co-founders: Chris, Alex and Tim.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Again, tech types and probably anyone running a website that\u2019s integral to their business, should listen to the podcast to hear the ins and outs of CodePen\u2019s protective measures. The high points included: minimizing the surface area of their site by reducing it to two ports, employing load balancers that could absorb the traffic from an attack, and housing assets behind a Content Delivery Network.<\/p>\n<p>Sabat also outlined the importance of understanding the normal behavior and traffic patterns of your site, \u201cso that you know what trouble looks like,\u201d he told podcast listeners. Sabat and co-founder Alex Vazquez spent a solid week on this. And on Day 5, the attack never materialized.<\/p>\n<p>While no one likes to do anything under duress, the team noted that the efforts were still worth it. Not only is CodePen\u2019s site ready in the event of any other DDoS threats, but it\u2019s also just running faster than before. \u201cAll is well in CodePen land for the moment,\u201d Coyier said.<\/p>\n<p>The trio acknowledged that they\u2019re slightly apprehensive that broadcasting their story might make CodePen a renewed target. But the startup regularly shares the ins and outs of its business via its podcasts, and especially in this case, the lessons learned may help others. So for at least today, the good guys win.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have five minutes and you like stories of good guys prevailing over evil bastards, then keep reading.
