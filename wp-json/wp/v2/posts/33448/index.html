By Taking Pre-Orders and Starting a Biz"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Thomas Sickler has been yearning after a 3D printer for three years &#8212; all the way back to when he was nine and started reading about them in Wired magazine. It\u2019s not surprising, given that this Bend 12-year-old is an inventor at heart.<\/p>\n<p>He spent last summer collecting wood to make a sail boat. He has a homemade \u2018reading lamp\u2019 hanging from the ceiling in his room. He once made a contraption that let him turn off his light switch without getting out of bed. Obviously a 3D printer was the ultimate.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33452\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33452\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33452\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160202_153303-e1454604571803-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"One of Thomas' inventions. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160202_153303-e1454604571803-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160202_153303-e1454604571803-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33452\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of Thomas&#8217; inventions.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>However, Thomas also has very lovely parents, who aren\u2019t inclined to simply buy him whatever he wants, nor did they know much about 3D printers. \u201cWe\u2019d only read a little about the technology in magazines or heard the occasional story on the news about someone using one to make an organ or a prosthetic limb,\u201d says his dad Tripp, who is the international sales manager for Ruffwear.<\/p>\n<p>His parents said no to Thomas&#8217; request many times. &#8220;Then I\u00a0began to think about the reasons he wanted a 3D printer. The &#8216;why&#8217; was obvious: he wanted to make stuff!&#8221; Tripp says. So one day, last fall, Tripp asked Thomas how much one of these things cost. Thomas, who had long been tracking models, prices, deals, where to download designs, etc. immediately responded that there was a Black Friday sale, offering a printer for $425 &#8212; plus free shipping and a roll of filament. \u201cThey used to cost more than a $1,000,\u201d Thomas notes.<\/p>\n<p>So Tripp threw out there that if Thomas could figure out a way to pay for one, Tripp could buy it and Thomas could pay him back. That\u2019s when the inventor also became a budding entrepreneur. Thomas downloaded designs from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/\">thingiverse<\/a> and then went door-to-door around his neighborhood, taking pre-orders for 3D printed key chains, light switch plates, iPad covers and other products.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33455\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33455\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33455\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0737-250x250.jpeg\" alt=\"Personalized key chains FTW.\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33455\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Personalized key chains FTW.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33454\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33454\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33454\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160202_153518-e1454604891988-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Light switch plates for sale. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160202_153518-e1454604891988-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20160202_153518-e1454604891988-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Light switch plates for sale.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He had commitments for nearly $400 within a couple of weeks. \u201cHe did it. What could I say?\u201d Tripp says. He helped his son order the printer, an XYZ da Vinci 1.0. The giant box arrived on Dec. 4. Thomas remembers the exact date. \u201cI was pretty excited,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33456\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33456\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33456\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_0580-250x250.jpeg\" alt=\"The 3D printer arrives. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 3D printer arrives.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>True to his word, Thomas went right to work fulfilling his pre-orders, printing products after school and on the weekends. They&#8217;re now done and delivered, except for a couple of items he\u2019s printing for his grandparents in Chile. But Thomas is still in business, ready to print more products and hoping to possibly save up for a bike.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s taking orders for all sorts of things you can 3D print, from Go-Pro mounts to toys to key chains and gears. He recently made a T-Rex head for a friend. He also personally has his sights set on printing a gigantic rocket. \u201cBut that would take like 1,000 hours of printing,\u201d he says. Something tells me, he\u2019ll probably make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>Side note: Thomas&#8217; mom notes that the business closes down early in the evening, because it&#8217;s noisy and Thomas also has homework.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to order products from Thomas, reach him at <a href=\"mailto:thomasinbend@gmail.com\">thomasinbend@gmail.com<\/a>. He can fill you in on what\u2019s available, prices (they\u2019re reasonable) and turnaround time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thomas Sickler has been yearning after a 3D printer for three years &#8212; all the way back to when he [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":33456,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1,6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33448"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=33448"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33448\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":33473,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33448\/revisions\/33473"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/33456"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=33448"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=33448"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=33448"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
