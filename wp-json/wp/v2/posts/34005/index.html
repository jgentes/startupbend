And a cool event slated for next Tuesday (8\/16) offers a prime example.<\/p>\n<p>Join Seven Peaks Ventures and Bruce Cleveland, a relatively new Bendite and founding partner of Menlo Park-based <a href=\"http:\/\/wildcat.vc\">Wildcat Ventures<\/a>, for a discussion on Traversing the Traction Gap &#8212; that is the span between\u00a0a startup\u2019s Initial Product Release (IPR) to Minimum Viable Traction (MVT). There&#8217;s only about two dozen spots left, so sign up soon.<\/p>\n<p>For early stage companies, successfully navigating the traction gap can lead to better outcomes for founders and investors. <a href=\"http:\/\/wildcat.vc\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/WildcatVP_TheTractionGapFramework.pdf\">From Wildcat Ventures<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In our decades of venture experience, we have seen thousands of successful startups go from an idea to product (the go-to-product phase), from product to traction (the go-to-market phase), and from traction to scale (the go-to-scale phase).<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, we have seen ample capital available for companies in the early, go-to-product phase and the later, go-to-scale phase, yet time and time again, too many companies falter in the middle, go-to-market phase, exposing themselves to lower valuations, significant financing risks, and suboptimal outcomes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So Bruce&#8217;s firm developed a framework for startups that outlines how get to that MVT, which can be &#8220;defined as a\u00a0point in a company\u2019s maturity\u2014whether it be a certain level of revenue growth, engagement, downloads, usage or the like\u2014that demonstrates market validation and signals positive growth trajectory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bruce plans to dig into what all goes into Traversing the Traction Gap on the 16th. Wildcat focuses its investments on pre-traction companies, applying this framework to help their startups deftly cross the traction gap and take off. <a href=\"http:\/\/wildcat.vc\/team\/bruce-cleveland\/\">Bruce and his partners\u00a0have experience<\/a> in working with Marketo, Seibel, Oracle, Ticketfly and more companies when they were still in early days.<\/p>\n<p>The firm also has a long-term relationship with Geoffrey Moore, author of Crossing the Chasm, which many founders have on their bookshelves, and they tap into Moore&#8217;s expertise as well.<\/p>\n<p>So: Traction gaps. Chasms. As a startup founder, there&#8217;s a lot of things you can fall into. But you can also prep your company to soar over these gaps like you&#8217;re an American Ninja Warrior. You&#8217;re all, &#8220;Salmon ladders? I do &#8217;em in your sleep. Jumping spiders? I put small children on your back to make it harder.&#8221; Your startup can be like <em>that<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Are you pumped? You should be.
