Some of you noticed that of the 11 speakers, only two are women. As one StartupBend reader and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristinluck\">growth strategist\/public speaker Kristin Luck<\/a> put it in a tweet, that\u2019s \u201cnot awesome.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nope, it&#8217;s not, and the lack of gender diversity in startups and tech remains a significant issue for our community to continue to discuss and address. But before we do, I think it&#8217;s important to point out that the Technology Association of Oregon and TAO\u2019s Central Oregon Coordinator Teri Hockett are not only keenly aware of tech\u2019s diversity problem\u2014they\u2019re some of the people working hardest here to tackle it.<\/p>\n<p>Teri is a driving force behind<a href=\"http:\/\/www.techoregon.org\/get-involved\/communities-labs\/bend-steam\"> TAO STEAM<\/a>, a group that launched a few months ago with the specific mission of creating a gender balance in STEAM careers. Their first meeting in June attracted more than a hundred people, and the group\u2019s momentum has been nothing short of inspiring. In fact, the two women speaking at Ignite TAO\u2014Zilaida Salgueiro and Kerri Fry\u2014are founding members of TAO STEAM.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34875\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34875\" style=\"width: 625px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-34875\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TAO-STEAM-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TAO-STEAM-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TAO-STEAM-500x374.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TAO-STEAM-768x574.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TAO-STEAM.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34875\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The TAO STEAM founding members at the group&#8217;s launch party in June.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cWe cast a wide net looking for women speakers for Ignite,\u201d Teri says. \u201cAs a woman who has worked in tech, and specifically on this issue of gender balance for decades, there are many reasons why equal representation continues to be a challenge\u2014even when you\u2019re trying hard to solve it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the big picture, the issue entails everything from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/news\/2017\/06\/24\/women-speak-up-about-silicon-valley-sexism\/103169902\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/tech\/news\/2017\/06\/24\/women-speak-up-about-silicon-valley-sexism\/103169902\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501875699663000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsXx8JfbcpDPXIwWdLVC59c_IlUg\">institutionally sexist workplace cultures <\/a>to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/news.cornell.edu\/stories\/2016\/11\/when-women-are-more-men-they-still-face-stem-bias\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/news.cornell.edu\/stories\/2016\/11\/when-women-are-more-men-they-still-face-stem-bias&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501875699663000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFCA9EE4nY1tKTXJwGeuGjHEGptw\">historic biases regarding women and STEM careers<\/a>\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencenewsforstudents.org\/blog\/eureka-lab\/confidence-math-predicts-girls-participation-stem\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.sciencenewsforstudents.org\/blog\/eureka-lab\/confidence-math-predicts-girls-participation-stem&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1501875699663000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKhqWy0ft5j3YhtGIc7Xjrwcf3qg\">the lack of confidence our girls have in their math and science capabilities<\/a>. The result: The number of women in tech remains relatively tiny. You can see it when you attend tech events. You can see it in the few number of women execs at tech companies, the limited number of women startup founders, and the declining percentage of women earning STEM degrees.<\/p>\n<p>But groups like TAO STEAM <em>don\u2019t want to see this anymore<\/em>. And t<a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/new-group-launches-w-party-mission-for-more-women-in-steam-careers\/\">hey\u2019re asking what can we do right here in Central Oregon<\/a> to bring more women into tech and support the ones that are there. While the problem can seem overwhelming for sure, there is good news: We can move the needle every single day. Women and men. It starts with getting informed and then getting involved.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings us back to Ignite TAO. I would hope that people don\u2019t dismiss Ignite because there\u2019s only two women on stage. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techoregon.org\/events\/ignite-tao-bend-v1\">Instead go to Ignite<\/a>, cheer loudly for all the speakers and show your support for the awesome women who are there. Then next year, help Teri and TAO spread the word to even more women.
