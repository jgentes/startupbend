First, the keynote is Doug Layman, managing partner of Arve Capital LLC, and former founder of Kadix Systems. From the news release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Doug Layman<\/strong> is a serial entrepreneur with over 30 years of experience in strategic consulting, technology, entrepreneurship, and investment in both Fortune 500 companies and startups. Layman was founder and President of Kadix Systems, an information technology and security company serving the Intelligence Community with clients including the NSA, DHS, FBI, and Department of Defense. Layman\u2019s keynote will explain how starting with an initial investment of $100, over the course of seven years, Kadix Systems grew to four locations, 350+ employees, and over $50 million in annual revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Layman currently manages an investment portfolio of early stage companies through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arvecapital.com\/Home_Page.html\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/www.arvecapital.com\/Home_Page.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1493149176663000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEE-CU63lE4LmQEFrqOXDjOqTQbzQ\">Arve Capital LLC<\/a> and supports philanthropic interests including OSU-Cascades and the Bethlehem Inn through the Layman Foundation. He is an avid rock climber, biker and skier, who splits his time between Bend, Oregon; Los Barriles, Mexico; and Chamonix, France.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There will also be company pitches from:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ashley Phelps, Founder of ColorKitchen<br \/>\n<\/strong>Ashley is an artist turned entrepreneur. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.colorkitchenfoods.com\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=http:\/\/www.colorkitchenfoods.com\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1493149176663000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNIZ4x_5jE34uoRqYVS6hs6pELeg\">ColorKitchen<\/a> developed out of her first business, which was creating natural children\u2019s paints made from plant colors. Stores eager for natural color baking solutions prompted Phelps to pivot her craft business into a line of natural food coloring products, now selling in over 900 stores nationwide, from Whole Foods to Target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>David Garcia, Founder and CEO CEVA Bike Fit Systems<br \/>\n<\/strong>David is a Bend resident and longtime recreational cyclist whose new software aims to solve a major chasm between the service that bike shops provide and what recreational bikers need: professional assistance to determine what bike is right for them. The software brings the expertise of skilled bike fitters into the ordinary sales process, by putting professional fitting skills into the hands of every bike sales person.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And Peter Ozolin, Co-founder and CEO of Manzama, will offer a company update.\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ozolin will give an update on the subscription-based, Software-as-a-Service platform that aggregates news, corporate press releases, industry and trade publications, and social media from the public domain.
