You\u2019ll find they are often entrepreneurs, and many of the attendees are local professionals interested in supporting the community.<\/p>\n<h2>Why organize around industry clusters?<\/h2>\n<p>Clusters are made up of professionals with experience in their industry, either as an investor, advisor, entrepreneur, or supporter. We&#8217;ve found every professional to be a potential advisor for others in the community.<\/p>\n<p>Each cluster should be viewed as a small startup community. They have similar needs and can benefit from working together. Most of them are trying to provide these types of services for their cluster:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Networking events<\/li>\n<li>Coworking space<\/li>\n<li>Startup incubation \/ accelerators<\/li>\n<li>Education opportunities for founders<\/li>\n<li>Mentorship from advisors in their industry<\/li>\n<li>Investors with knowledge of their industry<\/li>\n<li>News coverage \/ publicity<\/li>\n<li>Jobs \/ access to talent<\/li>\n<li>Membership programs &amp; sponsors (revenue)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Collectively, these groups bring a focal point to the entrepreneurial activity within a community, and by bringing them together we&#8217;ve been able to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meet monthly to discuss what issues are a priority for everyone<\/li>\n<li>Jointly pursue grants and other funding opportunities<\/li>\n<li>Cross-promote activities and share resources<\/li>\n<li>Have a single voice when interacting with local government<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This sketch shows the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edmorrison.com\/inside-a-regional-innovation-cluster\" target=\"_blank\">basic startup ecosystem<\/a> that evolves around clusters:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-32430 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5.png\" alt=\"Startup Community Ecosystem\" width=\"748\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5.png 748w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/5-500x396.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Once\u00a0you&#8217;ve\u00a0identified the clusters in your community:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find one or two representatives from each cluster and bring them together with a monthly meeting. Start by identifying the immediate goals of each cluster and where<\/p>\n<p>Once we got rolling, we discovered more industries that were eager to get involved. Our list of clusters expanded to include 3 more:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy<\/li>\n<li>Food &amp; Beverage<\/li>\n<li>Robotics<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that the investment community prefers <em>high-growth<\/em> businesses that are likely to offer a 3 to 7 year return on their investment. This means the ecosystem is slightly skewed towards scalable, exponential growth startups rather than what many call \u2018lifestyle\u2019 businesses.<\/p>\n<p>You can tell the difference by looking at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capgemini.com\/blog\/capping-it-off\/2014\/11\/why-embracing-startup-thinking-could-be-the-key-to-aligning-growth-with\" target=\"_blank\">growth path<\/a> for each type:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32431\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/6.png\" alt=\"Linear vs Exponential Startup Growth Trendline\" width=\"668\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/6.png 668w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/6-500x374.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As Kauffman points out, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kauffman.org\/newsroom\/2014\/09\/new-kauffman-sketchbook-debunks--four-persistent-myths-about-entrepreneurship\" target=\"_blank\">the majority of job growth in America comes from new and young companies<\/a>, so linear companies will contribute to the economic growth of your city and should not be excluded, however they may not benefit from the investor network in your community.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The majority of job growth in America comes from new and young companies. @KauffmanFDN<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How do you know which companies have high-growth potential?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve found the best way to determine if a company has high-growth potential is by identifying whether they sell a <strong>product<\/strong>\u00a0or a <strong>service<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>A product company has distribution potential (beer, software). A service company will usually focus on selling locally (realtors, accountants). Software as a Service (SaaS) companies create products that are distributed via the web and sold as a monthly subscription, often called a \u2018service\u2019.<\/p>\n<h2>How we measured the growth of our startup community:<\/h2>\n<p>Rather than using Kauffman\u2019s description of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kauffman.org\/blogs\/policy-dialogue\/2015\/april\/gauging-impact-a-closer-look-at-entrepreneurial-density\" target=\"_blank\">entrepreneurial density<\/a>, which is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Entrepreneurial density = (# treps + # startup or high growth co. employees) \/ adult population<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We decided to begin with a simple metric: <strong># of startups<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We asked people in our community how many startups they could name.
