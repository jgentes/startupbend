Bend startups!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m excited to be working with another Central Oregon business, to offer CAIRN\u2019s subscribers an honest solution to wasteful bottled water. I\u2019ve been talking with CAIRN since both our businesses were just concepts on how to make it work, and that day has finally come,\u201d says\u00a0Niki Singlaub, HYDAWAY&#8217;s founder.<\/p>\n<p>Cairn\u2019s subscribers receive a box with a sampling of new brands and products in the outdoor and recreational industry each month. Contents of the box are a complete surprise to the recipient; so only those for whom the Hydaway bottle is the best fit will receive the product. Cairn also gives companies featured in its boxes, the opportunity to get feedback from its customers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Another reason why our customers should be excited about this partnership is that we are going to get valuable product insights from Cairn&#8217;s subscribers that will help us to make Hydaway even better for the outdoor community,&#8221; Singlaub says.<\/p>\n<p>You can still sign up for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getCAIRN.com\">CAIRN\u2019s March box<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile Hydaway is also available as six local stores:\u00a0Newport Ave Market,\u00a0OutsideIn, Hopscotch Kids, Postal Connections-East Bend, Via Delia, and Visit Bend. The product is currently featured <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thegrommet.com\/hydaway\">on the Grommet<\/a>, and of course on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hydawaybottle.com\">Hydaway<\/a> website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you talk to startup founders about starting companies in Bend, they&#8217;ll often remark on how collaborative the town is [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":33672,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33671"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=33671"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33671\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":33674,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/33671\/revisions\/33674"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/33672"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=33671"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=33671"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=33671"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
