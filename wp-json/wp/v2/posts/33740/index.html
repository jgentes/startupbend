CEO Kent Schnepp is one of six startup founders competing in the growth stage competition of the OEN Angel Oregon Annual Showcase later this afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Finalist companies present their pitches to a crowd of over 300 investors, business leaders, and entrepreneurs, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oen.org\/calendar-events\/showcase\/?platform=hootsuite\">OEN Angel Oregon<\/a> website. One winner is awarded a check, typically ranging from $200,000 to $300,000.<\/p>\n<p>Past winners include Spaceview, Nouvola and Wild Friends Food. Odysys has been gathering steam since the company was founded in July 2014. The <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/bvc2015-recap-odysys-scratch-it-perfect-company-and-snoplanks-win-funds-panelists-win-a-lychee-martini\/\">startup won the Bend Venture Conference<\/a>, taking home $205,000 in investment. Cascade Angels also invested $100,000 in Odysys.<\/p>\n<p>Schnepp now has a team of nine (up from 3 less than a year ago) and the company moved from their downtown offices into new digs near the Old Mill. To refresh you memory, Odysys provides a digital marketing platform for hotels. The company has focused on the independent hotel market, looking to help hoteliers move away from online travel agencies, such as Expedia or Travelocity, which command steep commissions from the hotels for bookings.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33011\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33011\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-33011\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151016_164654-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Odysys at BVC 2015. \" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151016_164654-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151016_164654-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20151016_164654-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33011\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kent Schnepp, founder of Odysys, in middle, at BVC 2015.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The other growth stage finalists pitching today include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.collexion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Collexion<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.crystalclearcleanwater.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Crystal Clear Technologies<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iotashome.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">IOTAS<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.moonshadowmobile.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Moonshadow Mobile<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yellow-scope.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Yellow Scope<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OEN Angel Oregon also has a early stage competition today, with startups competing for a prize package of goods and services.
