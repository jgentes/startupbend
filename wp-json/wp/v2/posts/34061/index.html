The Bend-based demand agency was recently acquired by Square 2 Marketing out of Pennsylvania. The acquisition seems to be a match made in inbound marketing heaven (a special place where all emails are opened, everyone alway clicks on the content and all leads convert).<\/p>\n<p>Founded by Cari Baldwin, BlueBird Strategies is a Marketo partner and has long served enterprise-level demand generation clients. Meanwhile Square 2 Marketing is HubSpot&#8217;s largest partner. Put them together and you have an agency with deep experience and partnerships with two of the most popular marketing automation software platforms, and experience with most of the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Though the BlueBird team is primarily dispersed, the agency has an office at BendTECH. Half of BlueBird&#8217;s 12 employees live and work in Bend, and Baldwin says she&#8217;s planning to grow the Oregon team.\u00a0In addition to helming BBS, Baldwin also serves at the chief instructor of BendPoly, which just finished its second year.<\/p>\n<div>\u201cWe are going to continue \u2018business as usual\u2019 &#8211; providing high quality demand generation services to our amazing b2b clients, many of whom we have been working with for years. They will benefit from additional services including website development, and focused inbound marketing including SEO and content creation. The response from clients and partners has been very positive, and the BlueBird team is looking forward to the new opportunities that come with Square 2 Marketing,&#8221; Baldwin said via email this morning.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<p>She is now the new chief revenue officer at Square 2 Marketing, and her main focus will be retaining and growing her BBS team&#8217;s business as well as supporting Square 2 in sales.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31482\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31482\" style=\"width: 276px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-31482\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/cari-baldwin.jpg\" alt=\"Cari Baldwin, CEO of BlueBird Strategies\" width=\"276\" height=\"255\" data-wp-pid=\"31482\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31482\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cari Baldwin, CEO of BlueBird Strategies<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<div>BBS will continue to operate within Square 2 Marketing as a full-service demand generation agency and service Marketo customers. Its Bend location will be the new Square 2 Marketing West Coast office.<\/div>\n<div>More from Baldwin via the news release:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe see this as a combination of two top-tiered teams with the goal to create a very special business,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cI have had the pleasure of working with many smart marketing people over the course of my career, and the team at Square 2 Marketing is by far the leader in this space in terms of thought leadership and results. I could not be more excited about the incredible range of inbound marketing and inbound sales services we\u2019re able to offer our clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Square 2 folks are also pleased:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe BlueBird team is top-notch, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing their leadership in the Marketo community, in the same way we\u2019ve been a leader in the HubSpot community,\u201d says Mike Lieberman, president and chief inbound scientist at Square 2 Marketing. \u201cWe are on a mission to generate 1 million leads for our clients and to help businesses large and small evolve from traditional marketing to more dynamic, results-oriented, data-driven techniques for both sales and marketing. The acquisition of BlueBird rounds out our ability to service larger enterprise clients and adds skills that help us generate leads for businesses of all shapes and sizes.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Congrats to the hard-working BBS crew.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our friends over at BlueBird Strategies have some exciting news to share.
