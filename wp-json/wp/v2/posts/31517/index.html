Founder Rob Little started the business in March as an extension of an idea he had while an MBA student at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business. He&#8217;s quickly gained traction with a loyal subscriber base of more than 300. And he&#8217;ll be pitching Cairn as one of the concept stage companies in the Bend Venture Conference. We caught up with Little to learn more about his company and how he&#8217;s aiming to make waves in the outdoor industry as well as meet the startup&#8217;s first and only furry mascot.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong>Startup spotlight:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getcairn.com\/\">Cairn<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong>Started:<\/strong>\u00a0March 2014<br \/>\n<strong>Founder:<\/strong> Rob Little<\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong>Employees:<\/strong> 2<\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong>Headquarters:<\/strong> Bend<\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong>Star Wars Decor:<\/strong> Nada.

We offer a $25 subscription service, delivering a selection of gear, apparel, food\/energy, and skincare products to our subscribers&#8217; doors monthly. We also collect information on what types of activities our subscribers are interested in. \u00a0As we grow, we&#8217;ll be able to customize the content of the boxes to fit specific interests. Additionally, we work with brands in the outdoor industry to put product immediately in the hands of their target market, and to get feedback on the product. Our subscribers are incentivized to review the content they receive, which helps the brands understand how they&#8217;re doing in the marketplace.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong><strong><strong> What inspired your idea?<\/strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">The model has been around for 80 years, when Harry and David started their Fruit of the Month Club. In the past five years, the model has been applied to a variety of other industries: cosmetics, clothing, food, and dog products, to name a few.\u00a0 As an outdoor enthusiast, I wanted to see a service applied to the outdoor industry as a whole.\u00a0 As I build the model and talked to brands in the industry about their interest in participating, I was encouraged to run with the idea.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong>Is this a competitive space? If so, how are you differentiating Cairn?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">Our approach is to build a box that caters to the entire outdoor industry, and uses profile settings to vary the content of the boxes. We haven&#8217;t found anyone else using this approach. There are boxes that cater to segments of the outdoor industry: fishing, biking, running, and golf. I don&#8217;t think that they are direct competitors, as some people want a box that caters specifically to their strongest passion and others want a box that fits a wider range of interests.<\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_31523\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31523\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141003_102932-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31523\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141003_102932-1-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Christmas every month. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141003_102932-1-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141003_102932-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141003_102932-1-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31523\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christmas every month.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><strong> What&#8217;s the response from retailers\/manufacturers and subscribers been so far?\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">The response from the retailers and manufacturers has been incredible. The brands we work with are very excited about the data we are providing back to them, in the form of demographics and product reviews. Many of them have commented that we&#8217;re the only subscription service who has offered that type and level of insight. We now have brands reaching out to us, inquiring about how to be put in our box. It helps that we&#8217;re not a threat to their existing distribution channels. If our subscribers like the content in the box, they go through those traditional channels to purchase more product. Everyone wins. Our subscribers love the service as well. The most frequent comment we get is that it&#8217;s like Christmas, once a month.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"color: #222222;\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div><strong>Where does your revenue come from?<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Currently our revenue comes from our subscriptions.
