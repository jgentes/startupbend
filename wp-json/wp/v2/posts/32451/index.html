They launched <a href=\"http:\/\/torhans.com\">TorHans<\/a> in 2010 to &#8220;conspire against the wind&#8221; by offering aerodynamic hydration products for athletes based on a void Hans, a former pro racer and Southwest Airlines pilot, noticed in the market.<\/p>\n<p>BendTECH sat down with both Hans and Tor to learn how their idea became a well-known brand among competitive athletes (in fact, the company sponsors 25 triathletes). Their products were also part of two wins at the Ironman World Championships and dozens of Ironman victories.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2001.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32455\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2001-500x375.png\" alt=\"IMG_2001.PNG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2001-500x375.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2001.png 679w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Startup: <\/strong>TorHans<strong><br \/>\nYear Started:<\/strong> 2010<br \/>\n<strong>Leadership\/Founders:<\/strong> Tor Naerheim, Chief Marketing Officer; Hans Bielat, Chief Innovation Officer; Kevin Cox, Consultant<br \/>\n<strong>Employees:<\/strong> 3 full-time employees, 3 contract engineers<br \/>\n<strong>Headquarters<\/strong>: Bend<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where did the idea come from?<\/strong><br \/>\nWell it was pretty simple, Hans noticed bicycles, wheels and aero handle bars were all very aerodynamic, while the hydration systems were not at the time. They were just an afterthought even though hydration is necessary for performance. Tor brought his entrepreneurial experience and design know-how to the team and we&#8217;ve been working to innovate systems that eliminate aerodynamic drag associated with hydration, tool, and nutrition storage ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Living in Bend is also an inspiration. Where else (short of Boulder) do you have such amazing riding and a collection of incredible and dedicated athletes? Two world class professional triathletes in town use our products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the design process like?<\/strong><br \/>\nOur design process was long and started with basic sketches as ideas often do. We partnered with an aero engineers to refine the shape and make\u00a0it\u00a0a working hydration unit. We also tested\u00a0some rapid prototypes with Felt Bicycles at a wind tunnel. The results showed our design\u00a0exceeded other similar products\u00a0aerodynamically. This was good validation for us to go ahead.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1998.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32456\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1998-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1998.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1998-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_1998.jpg 567w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where are your products produced?<\/strong><br \/>\nOriginally we wanted to manufacturer the products in the U.S. We could find a blow molder in Tennessee, an injection mold company in Colorado, and a compression and extrusion molder in California. But no one\u00a0could do everything\u00a0with packaging, color, and graphics. The numbers\u00a0just and are still not there\u2026which is eye opening and disconcerting. We do feel though that a lot of this in the future will be solved through the evolving technology of 3D printing machines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What makes your products different?<\/strong><br \/>\nSome competitors just slap their name on an existing product from a trading company. These are called open mold products, and are much cheaper than building your own design. But this is not who we are and not function like we want. The design, tooling and production of a product such as the AeroZ cost upwards of $70,000. We own all of our molds and tools stored with our manufacturing partner in Taiwan.<\/p>\n<p>We are still the only bicycle hydration company that uses airfoil aerodynamic shapes as the starting template for our products. \u00a0And obviously we&#8217;re biased\u2026but our products just look so much better than anything else out there.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2006-e1431626214591.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32457\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_2006-500x334.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2006.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you funded?<\/strong><br \/>\nFunding for TorHans came from the founders along with a loan from local company Craft3. We are in growth stage now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So do these really work, or just look cool\/intimidating?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe carriage of hydration on a bicycle had been sometimes 30% of the total aerodynamic drag of the athlete&#8217;s bicycle. Our current hydration and storage systems eliminate the drag, and some systems actually give an aerodynamic benefit. In Ironman with a 112 mile bike portion, TorHans systems have saved\u00a0six minutes over not carrying any hydration at all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s next?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe just launched out newest hydration product, the AeroZ. Triathlete Magazine just named it &#8220;Best in Class&#8221; and sales are exceeding expectations.\u00a0We&#8217;re now working at various levels with seven bicycle manufactures to &#8216;Aeroblend&#8217; custom hydration\/storage products on the manufactures bicycles. \u00a0Finally, new\u00a0bicycle aerodynamic products and run hydration products are on the drawing board.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tor Naerheim and Hans Blielat grew up only one street apart, and discovered by chance 20 years later that they [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":189,"featured_media":32458,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32451"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/189"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32451"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32451\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32466,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32451\/revisions\/32466"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/32458"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32451"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32451"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32451"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
