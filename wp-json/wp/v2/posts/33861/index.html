All that line time? Just gone. Now when are you going to look at Facebook?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/50startups-the-flybook-catches-more-customers\/\">CEO Craig Langer<\/a> says the idea for the product evolved after a customer discovered his company at the American Outdoors Association show last year in Salt Lake. \u201cThey were looking for other options when it came to their ticketing process, and they weren\u2019t finding much,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31697\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31697\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-31697\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"The Flybook co-founder Craig Langer.\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-250x250.jpg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014-11-12-14.26.26-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31697\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Flybook CEO Craig Langer.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Creating a Smart Ticket system proved a natural extension of The Flybook\u2019s flagship product, online booking software for tour guides and outfitters. The system releases tickets in batches, allowing customers to buy tickets for a predetermined time, instead of waiting in line. An integration with <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/bend-tech-startup-smartwaiver-acquired-by-a-bay-area-team\/\">Smartwaiver<\/a> (two Bend tech companies working together: I\u2019m crying) wraps all the release waivers into the purchase as well.<\/p>\n<p>From The Flybook:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>One of the many features of Smart Tickets is a control called \u201cticket rationing.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 This allows business owners to flex in real time their availability.\u00a0 For example, imagine a waterpark that has a capacity of 500, and the facility opens at 8:00am. The water park can release tickets for entry based on their maximum capacity. They can release a larger block of tickets early in the day in order to encourage a ramp up to their daily capacity. Then the system can hold at that capacity.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words the rationing allows for segmented ticket disbursement so that businesses can get to capacity faster, stay there for longer periods of time. Business then can leverage that data for targeted micro-promotions for forecasted attendance variances.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In addition, a QR code on each ticket means that tour operators know when their customers have completed the activity (which they often do before their time limit) and allows them bring in more adventurers. The tour operators essentially have a real-time look at the capacity in their parks or tours, and can maximize their operations as a result.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33863\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33863\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33863\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/climbing-park-812306_1920-500x333.jpg\" alt=\"More adventure!\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/climbing-park-812306_1920-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/climbing-park-812306_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/climbing-park-812306_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/climbing-park-812306_1920-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/climbing-park-812306_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">More adventure!

The Smart Ticket system is currently at 12 locations, and Langer anticipates they\u2019ll process 500,000 tickets this year.<\/p>\n<p>In meantime, the company&#8217;s reservation software remains steady business, even as the market has exploded with competitors. \u201cOur product is as stable as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Langer says. The Flybook was a growth stage finalist at the Bend Venture Conference in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>The company remains fully bootstrapped, though Langer says he\u2019s still open to funding. It currently has 8 employees now and a planned 13 by the end of August. They also moved into office downtown. And Langer assures that there\u2019s more news from to come.
