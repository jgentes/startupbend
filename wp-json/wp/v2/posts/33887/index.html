Now nearly a year into the grand experiment, he has good news &#8212; it&#8217;s working.<\/p>\n<p>The company moved into its new 4,000-square-foot office space in the 1001 Tech Center in July 2015. Kollective relocated a dozen Californian employees here in the process and then hired a dozen more, including many from Bend. The company now has half its staff in Sunnyvale and half here.<\/p>\n<p>In the first few months, Vetras noted that recruiting posed a challenge, with the Bend office looking for more applicants. But by the end of year, they&#8217;d filled all their open positions &#8212; and they&#8217;ll likely hire more. Vetras says drawing on the Bend tech network and word-of-mouth referrals helped build the company&#8217;s pipeline for technical and non-technical positions. He&#8217;s made hires who don&#8217;t need to move here, but still want to anyway.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeing in Bend has made recruiting better for Kollective,&#8221; Vetras says. &#8220;We are interviewing people who have chosen to live here and who enjoy what the great location has to offer.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33899\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33899\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-33899\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image003.png\" alt=\"Kollective's Bend team taking some time off to volunteer. \" width=\"620\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image003.png 620w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image003-500x282.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kollective&#8217;s Bend team taking some time off to volunteer.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Kollective&#8217;s technology powers live and on-demand video delivery for large corporations. For example, Kollective&#8217;s customers include some of the world&#8217;s largest corporations, and Kollective&#8217;s product suite helps them live stream speeches by their executives or distribute video training to tens of thousands of employees. In 2015, they experienced 100% renewal from their customers.<\/p>\n<p>Just last week, the company announced that<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendbulletin.com\/business\/4340693-151\/bend-tech-company-raises-123-million\"> it had raised a $12.25 million Series C round <\/a>to fund its expansion into Asian markets, leverage its partnership with\u00a0Microsoft Skype Meeting Broadcast partnership and fuel strategic growth and R&amp;D.<\/p>\n<p>From the company&#8217;s news release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur product suite is expanding to help customers with new IT challenges including the proliferation of video as a strategic imperative,&#8221; Vetras says. \u201cWe are witnessing an explosive growth in enterprise-scale customers who leverage video as a key form of communication to dispersed employees worldwide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dramatic increases in video traffic and the ongoing challenge of delivering software updates has large enterprises looking to deploy an infrastructure that can address their needs. This includes partnering with a cloud-based, content delivery provider that can be leveraged in multiple use cases within the network. Kollective is the only solution that can effectively and efficiently address all use cases.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So they&#8217;ve been busy. Regardless, Vetras has prioritized connecting the company and employees with their new town. They do a quarterly community service event, most recently volunteering at the Salvation Army. Vetras is also planning to bring the entire California office (22 people) up to Central Oregon for a weekend of Bend fun this summer. The group will also do a community service project while they&#8217;re together.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33900\" style=\"width: 621px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-33900\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/image001.png\" alt=\"CEO Dan Vetras, left, and many Kollective staff.
