So it seems like the perfect time to introduce you to one of Bend\u2019s newest startups, <a href=\"http:\/\/kidcareshare.com\/join\/\">kidcareshare<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Founded by Bendite Jen Ortado, kidcareshare is an app that helps parents connect, schedule and trade childcare, carpools and play dates. It\u2019s honestly one of those things that I found myself wishing I had six years ago. Jen, where were you when my daughter got booted out of her daycare not once, but three times, bless her heart. But we don&#8217;t have a time machine, so we&#8217;ll take it now!<\/p>\n<p>Jen wants her app to not only help parents find childcare, but to also make childcare more affordable and help people build community along the way. \u201cI had the idea several years ago when I was still living in L.A.,\u201d Jen says. \u201cMy daughter was a baby, and I was working full-time and driving her eight miles to daycare. There was no time to connect with other moms and I really wanted a tribe.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34945\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34945\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34945 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/File_000-375x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/File_000-375x500.jpeg 375w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/File_000-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/File_000.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jen and her lovely daughter.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>She recalled her own mom talking about how she and her neighbors used to trade poker chips for childcare. And her idea \u2013 that parents could more equitably trade child care \u2013 started percolating. Jen moved to Bend and tried to start a similar coop at her daughter\u2019s Montessori school. \u201cI had all these other parents say sign me up, but then I ended up being a working mom trying to manage 12 other families\u2019 schedules.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tech to the rescue <\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately as her idea evolved, so did technology. Jen\u2019s daughter headed to elementary school, and Jen created the school&#8217;s parent Facebook group to test the waters. But again, there were limitations. \u201cIt was hard to organize subgroups or target care requests to specific people, without cluttering up the feed,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>She started to think that an app could handle all this communication around childcare in a much more streamlined way. A former marketing manager, she started developing a plan to create kidcareshare earlier this year.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34946\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34946\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-34946 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/notes-500x432.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/notes-500x432.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/notes-768x663.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/notes.jpg 1012w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Looking good &#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The idea is basically this:\u00a0Parents create an account within the app and bank a starting balance of points for each child in their profile. They can trade these points for care. Parents can search for trusted peers to add to their network, using their own connections or a code provided by school, or a community activity.<b><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b>\u00a0As a parent, you can both request help with childcare as well as offer your own time for watching kids, hauling kids to soccer or meeting the neighborhood gaggle at the bus stop.<\/p>\n<p>You accrue points for providing care, and you draw down your points to get care. This latter feature is critical. As Jen notes, \u201cevery parent struggles to ask for help.\u201d But by tracking the care you give and take, the app takes the guilt out of the system \u2013 and makes it more equitable.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, app users can also convert their points to credits, and then use them to get discounts on products and services from local and national companies. So helping your neighbor out could also help you save a few bucks the next time you go out to dinner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prepping for launch<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know. You have questions. I had a few too. First, what if there are crazy yahoos on the app that I don\u2019t want watching my kids? Jen gently pointed out, that just like any social network,\u00a0parents\u00a0control who they invite into their communities. Just as parents vet care providers in person, they get to decide who they want to connect with, and then who they ultimately reach out to for requesting or offering care.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-34948 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/upside-down-500x333.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/upside-down-500x333.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/upside-down.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And what about privacy? Again Jen has anticipated this. Via the app, you get to decide who sees information about your family. But what if you only take childcare and don\u2019t offer any? Well, at some point \u2013 you\u2019re gonna have to give. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.<\/p>\n<p>Jen bootstrapped a prototype of her app, and is now raising $15,000 to help fund the development of the beta version. She\u2019s considering a freemium revenue model, with added features available to users who subscribe.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s running a gofundme campaign <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/kidcareshare-beta?donorname=Valerie+Yost\">that you can check out and contribute to, if you\u2019re so inclined<\/a>. She plans to keep the beta launch local, and you can also sign up to be one of the first kidcareshare users \u2013 and perhaps lighten your own childcare load in the process.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re using technology to connect parent communities on a broader scale,\u201d Jen says. \u201cThis app helps take away both the cost burden of childcare and the scheduling hassle.\u201d We like that the sound of that. Good luck Jen!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With school back in session, life gets a little more scheduled &#8212; and lot busier &#8212; for families.
