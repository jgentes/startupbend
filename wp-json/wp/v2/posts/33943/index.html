The company is the newest venture for serial entrepreneur Mark Silliman, who sold his most recent company, <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/bend-tech-startup-smartwaiver-acquired-by-a-bay-area-team\/\">Smartwaiver<\/a>, late last year.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s joined by co-founders James Gentes, founder of Startupcommunity.org and the Social Business, which was also acquired last year, as well as co-founder of this very blog; and Robert Kieffer, a well-known Bend developer and tech community supporter who was part of Zenbe, which sold to Facebook in 2010. They&#8217;re currently working out of BendTECH &#8212; it&#8217;s the office with the giant robot. For reals.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/06\/22\/tend-ai-trains-your-robot-to-operate-dozens-of-3d-printers-and-laser-cutters-at-a-time\/\">From TechCrunch<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you\u2019ve got more than a handful of\u00a03D printers or other devices running at a time, it\u2019s a full-time job keeping them going \u2014 removing and packaging products, tweaking settings, pushing \u201cOK\u201d after minor errors, that sort of thing. Why not have a robot do it for you?<a href=\"http:\/\/tend.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tend.ai<\/a> is a new company that helps you train collaborative robots to perform machine tending, something generally reserved for bots serving heavy industry.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33944\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33944\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-33944 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tend-ai-500x309.jpg\" alt=\"tend ai\" width=\"500\" height=\"309\" data-wp-pid=\"33944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tend-ai-500x309.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tend-ai-768x474.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tend-ai-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tend-ai-800x494.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tend-ai.jpg 1044w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33944\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit Tend.ai<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Silliman notes that he conceived the venture after he noticed that his friend&#8217;s wife had dozens of 3-D printers and was having to mind them every few minutes. Maybe a collaborative robot could do it instead? But these robots aren&#8217;t that easy to configure, primarily because they&#8217;re made for assembly lines, not DIY type work, according to TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>More from the story:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Working with an \u201cintegrator\u201d to customize the platform, and getting the special hardware for computer vision or web monitoring can cost tens of thousands on top of the robot itself.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe basically spun up this system that moves all this data to the cloud,\u201d said Silliman. \u201cNow you can use a $100 webcam to do OCR and the whole nine yards, AI and machine learning, without having any of these resources in-house. And you can do it without modifying the machines or voiding their warranties. You can use any robot, any webcam, and it\u2019s just plug and chug.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Tend.ai system consists of a small computer, provided for free, that acts as a thin client, passing data to and from the robot and webcam, which you attach to its arm. All the configuration data and instructions are stored in the cloud.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/K5WYLnOcggY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Tend.ai is using a SaaS business model. Its database will include info on common machines such as 3-D printers and laser cutters. If your machine is less well-known, then you can actually use the system to train the robot yourself.<\/p>\n<p>And a bit more on why this is a big deal, even if you don&#8217;t have 17 3-D printers &#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; if it works as advertised, Tend.ai\u2019s system could allow machines to run 24\/7 without human intervention \u2014 lowering costs, increasing productivity or both.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Silliman says he&#8217;s been bombarded by interest since the TC story posted. The Tend.ai crew anticipate launching a beta product in July and raising somewhere around $2 million after that to fund further development.
