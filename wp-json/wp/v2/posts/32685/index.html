Startups here received $15,850,000 in investment over the past year, according to Brian Vierra, EDCO&#8217;s venture catalyst.<\/p>\n<p>Vierra tracks a \u00a0portfolio of 75 Central Oregon startups, and one-third of them raised money over EDCO&#8217;s fiscal year, which ended June 30.<\/p>\n<p>Vierra started his position in spring 2014 and doesn&#8217;t have equivalent data to make a clean comparison with the previous year, though it appears to be a marked uptick. His inherited records show that startups here received about $2 million the prior year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a clear and compelling increase in both startup activity and funding,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the funding facts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The nearly $16 million in investment accounts for debt and equity raises, though the majority is equity.<\/li>\n<li>Though all industries are represented, most of the investment was made in tech.<\/li>\n<li>Most of the funding would be considered seed, or funding for early-stage startups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Vierra says that even with the increase in startup funding, Oregon still faces a capital deficit. But things in Bend seem to be moving in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What it tells me is that there are a plethora of compelling ideas and concepts being turned into viable businesses,&#8221; he says. &#8220;When this happens, the money follows and I expect that amount of investment being made in Central Oregon startups to continue to increase.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The availability of funds for startups coming straight out of Central Oregon has definitely grown. The Bend Venture Conference has evolved into the PNW&#8217;s largest angel conference, awarding more than $1 million in investments and prizes in 2014. Bend-based Cascade Angels raised $725,000 for its second fund, which was a 58% increase from the year before. Seven Peaks Ventures also invested in Bend and Portland startups over the past year.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31612\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31612\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_134724.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31612\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_134724-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Carroll, CSO of Amplion, BVC Launch Stage Winner. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_134724-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_134724-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141017_134724-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Adam Carroll, CSO of Amplion, on stage at BVC.

And though some of the more mature tech companies might just eat $16 million for breakfast, the increase of seed funding here is crucial to the success of Bend startups. These first, small raises act as the accelerant that can help turn a spark of a good business into something bigger. That early stage funding plays a crucial role in the sustainability of our startup ecosystem &#8212; we&#8217;re excited to see what comes of it.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31628\" style=\"width: 364px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BVC2014-Volcano-Veggies-Winner-Shot_web.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31628\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BVC2014-Volcano-Veggies-Winner-Shot_web-364x500.gif\" alt=\"Jim and Shannon Sbarra. co-founders of Volcano Veggies, showing off their giant checks.
