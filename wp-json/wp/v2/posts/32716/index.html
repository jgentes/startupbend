However, he&#8217;s had many clients test the waters across the Pacific and return to SisTech. &#8220;China is not all it&#8217;s cracked up to be,&#8221; said\u00a0Kennedy. &#8220;Is it always going to be more expensive here than in China? Absolutely, but by the time you figure out shipping, duties, taxes, fine print, I think you&#8217;ll\u00a0find it&#8217;s not much\u00a0more than doing business here.\u00a0We stand by our quality, protect your IP, and ship products as you need them instead of requiring a big upfront order.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Local tech company\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pulsedlight3d.com\">PulsedLight<\/a>, a <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50-startups-pulsedlight-helps-drones-fly-safely\/\">recent\u00a0#50Startups<\/a>, tasked Kennedy and his team with assembling their LIDAR-Lite product, a favorite in the small drone industry.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/logo2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32737\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/logo2.jpg\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"450\" height=\"128\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We invest heavily in technology,&#8221; says Kennedy. &#8220;It\u2019s all about keeping current with the industry, always being able to build anything.\u00a0I invested substantially\u00a0in the last 10 months to keep up and add capacity. For example, a 3D X-Ray allowing for non-destructive failure analysis of electronic assemblies will be\u00a0installed this month.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SisTech produces approximately 700 products a year. If you\u00a0have something ready to launch from your garage or local makerspace, SisTech might help you avoid the pitfalls of hardware tech startups, and create a product truly made in Bend.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In your dreams, you&#8217;ve designed the NEXT BIG THING, raised more than you ever hoped on Kickstarter, and life is [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":189,"featured_media":32733,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[15,14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32716"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/189"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32716"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32716\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32749,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32716\/revisions\/32749"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/32733"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32716"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32716"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32716"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
