We also know that they&#8217;re often an under represented group. And we know that finding ways to further encourage women&#8217;s entrepreneurship benefits the whole community.<\/p>\n<p>So a group of startup women founders and supporters (myself included) have organized an evening dedicated to Bend&#8217;s startup women. It&#8217;s Tuesday Jan. 19 from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m at BendTECH. \u00a0And we&#8217;d love for you to join us.<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have a real conversation about women and entrepreneurship right here in Bend. We want to learn: What challenges do women founders face, what resources are currently available and what can the community do to help foster more women-run startups and ultimately help women succeed?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot of big questions. We get it. And as of now, we&#8217;re not sure of the answers. But digging in the first step. So let&#8217;s do it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also there\u2019s wine. And it&#8217;s free.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can <a href=\"http:\/\/bendstartupwomentalk.eventbrite.com\">register here.<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Whether you can join us or not, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/r\/JZ67CFW\">please fill out this survey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And lastly, just climbing up on my soapbox for a sec: Given that our startup community is relatively young and still forming, we get the rare opportunity to make it what we want. It doesn&#8217;t have to look like everywhere else and frankly it could be better than everywhere else. Right? We can at this early stage create an inclusive community that supports all entrepreneurs. Imagine how awesome that would be.
