To date, more than 80 percent of the BendPoly graduates seeking roles in digital marketing have found positions in industry and government.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Bruce Cleveland, founding partner of Wildcat Ventures and co-founder of GreenFig University, says the first two years with BendPoly confirmed the demand from companies wanting qualified people to run Marketo and other digital marketing applications.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe placement rates of the BendPoly program were remarkable. As a result, we elected to create GreenFig University, expand its scope beyond digital marketing, and scale the program nationally,\u201d Bruce says.<\/p>\n<p>The university will partner with Marketo, Inc., the leading provider of engagement marketing software and solutions, to co-develop a digital marketing course and support GreenFig\u2019s instructors with delivery in select cities across the United States.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-34613\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/greenfig.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"96\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first GreenFig University course is in Digital Marketing Science and will available this fall, with the semester starting Aug. 16.
