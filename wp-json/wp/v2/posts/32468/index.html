TEDxBendWomen provides a forum for local women to tell their stories, while also helping attendees engage with one another to start conversations about ideas that matter. In addition, women lead busy lives leading organizations, raising families, giving to their local community that they rarely do something for themselves. On <span data-term=\"goog_772395350\">May 30<\/span>, TEDxBendWomen will \u00a0honor the amazing women in our community working for change with a day of inspiration, networking, celebration, connection, and fun.<\/p>\n<p>As the co-chairs for TEDxBendWomen, we are excited to see our second TEDxBendWomen event come together. In April, we had over 60 speaker suggestions of great women in Central Oregon with powerful ideas and stories to share. We have landed on five speakers, two musical debuts, a lively panel, and a little poetry to provoke thought and inspiration. In addition, to the amazing performance\u00a0line-up, we have over 20 Central Oregon women artist displaying their art during\u00a0\u00a0the event. The day will be engaging and\u00a0interactive with discussions, networking and activities for attendees.<\/p>\n<p>Our event is being done in sync with the TEDWomen event in Monterey <span data-term=\"goog_772395351\">May 26 to 29<\/span>, and we will show two of the inspiring new sessions from that event to our attendees.\u00a0In order to attract a diverse audience from all walks of life, we have purposefully priced the event\u00a0at $10 for admission.<\/p>\n<p>To allow us to make tickets so affordable we thank our amazing sponsors this year: Central Oregon Community College, Bend Broadband, Old Mill District, Humm Kombucha, Straw Propeller, BackPorch Coffee, Life Flight Network, Super Foods, Hand-in-Hand Productions,\u00a0Maria Fernanda Bay Photography, Worthy, TEDxBend, Microsoft Research, and Moementum, Inc.
