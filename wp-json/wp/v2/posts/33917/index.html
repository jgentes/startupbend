The new investments bring the startup&#8217;s total seed round to $2 million.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a brand partner, I have experienced Cairn first hand.\u00a0The data they provide to brands greatly informs product\u00a0development, marketing and innovation. At the same time, they are bringing together a unique\u00a0community of consumers, all with a love of the outdoors,\u201d says Allan, who is also joining Cairn&#8217;s board of directors.<\/p>\n<p>Hydro Flask was acquired by Helen of Troy for $210 million in February. Cairn plans to draw on Allan&#8217;s experience in creating shareholder value across outdoor products, positioning companies, commercializing technologies, building brands and managing growth.<\/p>\n<p>Cairn, which provides subscription boxes to outdoor enthusiasts, has grown rapidly since its founding in Bend in 2014, and is a prime example of Central Oregon&#8217;s burgeoning outdoor industry. The startup was one of the first Bend Outdoor Worx accelerator graduates and a Bend Venture Conference early stage finalist.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33527\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33527\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33527\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Photo-Jan-06-8-24-00-AM-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"The Cairn team -- a BOW alum. \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Photo-Jan-06-8-24-00-AM-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Photo-Jan-06-8-24-00-AM-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Photo-Jan-06-8-24-00-AM-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Photo-Jan-06-8-24-00-AM-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Cairn team taking time out to ski this winter.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Julie Harrelson, Cascade Angels fund manager, says that Central Oregon has an opportunity to become an innovation hub for the outdoor industry. &#8220;Cairn is a part\u00a0of that ecosystem and a strategic investment for the fund,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>Cascade Angels aims to drive economic growth by investing in Oregon companies.

The funding will help the company expand its team and product offerings and continue to grow its subscriber base.<\/p>\n<p>The company previously announced in February that it had raised $1.7 million from investors including\u00a0Brian Spaly, founder of Bonobos and founder and CEO of Trunk Club; Rick Dalzell, former Amazon SVP and CIO and board member of Intuit; and Jim Collis, private equity partner at Seaport Capital and HydroFlask board member.<\/p>\n<p>Cairn began as an idea in Little&#8217;s retail marketing class at Wharton. It\u00a0now counts more than 10,000 subscribers, who receive monthly boxes filled with new outdoor gear.\u00a0Jared Peterson, Little&#8217;s co-founder and classmate from business school, left Apple to joint the company full-time as CTO in December.<\/p>\n<p>The box is certainly integral to the business, but the pair also see it as a foundation for creating an engaged community of outdoor lovers and consumers, and as a vehicle for gathering invaluable data for the brands the box features. It&#8217;s the latter that has set the industry a buzz. About 40% of Cairn subscribers offer feedback on the products they get inside their Cairn boxes, a feedback rate that\u2019s exceptionally high, the co-founders say.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31519\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31519\" style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-31519\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20141003_102158-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"Rocco, Little's dog (then a puppy) and Cairn mascot.
