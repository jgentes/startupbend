Once there, he landed a job with FujiFilm. He worked for $8 an hour learning the technology behind digital photography and software systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entry level opportunity segued into a full-time job as Christian then moved his way up and around the company. He spent nearly six years as a lab systems engineer before transitioning into fulfillment, managing product and operations relations for clients such as Shutterfly, WalMart, Rite-Aid and more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were taking the brick and mortar one-hour photo concept and putting it online,\u201d he says. \u201cWe digitized the process; it was a really exciting time.\u201d He used that valuable experience to come back home about four years ago, landing a position as a Sr. Project Manager at G5. Then he started to get the entrepreneurial itch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Creating PixyPics<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time helping build other people\u2019s businesses,\u201d Christian says. \u201cI wanted to see if I could do it on my own.\u201d After leaving G5 Christian started a digital marketing consulting business, and began to ponder the beginnings of PixyPics.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35055\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35055\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35055\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DSC_8768-500x324.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DSC_8768-500x324.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DSC_8768-768x498.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DSC_8768-1024x664.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35055\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jordan Sofrow, Tor Naerheim, Christian Rea, Nate Kay and Vinny (the pup) of PixyPics<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years removed from Fuji, he still loved the power of photos to tell a story or evoke a memory, and he was intrigued by how businesses could facilitate a bigger positive impact. He determined that he could combine the two, creating a photo gifts and products business that gave back to charitable organizations\u2014something to help it stand out from the others in the space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He partnered up with Nate Kay, who he met at G5 after discovering they had a shared passion for photography. Nate is a successful photo blogger who runs <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thephotoargus.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Photo Argus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and also works with Christian to support his digital marketing Clients. He\u2019s also recruited Tor Naerheim, a nationally recognized designer who\u00a0 has helped build brands for some of the most recognized companies in America over the past 20 years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trio launched PixyPics in July, with the idea of giving back a fifth of its net revenue to a growing cadre of causes, which currently includes the KIDS Center in Bend and Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A community approach <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is getting creative with how it promotes PixyPic\u2019s products and mission of community support. For example, the company is launching a campaign this fall called \u201cWrapped in Love.\u201d The plan is to give blankets with special photos of family and other loved ones to kids at Doernbecher\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PixyPics is also gearing up to run a promotion giving away a free canvas print to people who sent in a family photo with a story about their family. Christian says that he wants his company\u2019s community focus to impact not just nonprofits, but also customers and of course, the people that work for him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe want to be a community,\u201d he says. \u201cOur employees and our customers come first and their families, then together we can support partnerships with nonprofit organizations and companies.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It definitely makes shopping feel that much better.
