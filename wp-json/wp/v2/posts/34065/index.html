Simbaware Targets Medical Device Manufacturers"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>There are a few tech companies in Bend building enterprise SaaS products for businesses in that mysterious middle: Too big for a simple, off-the-shelf solutions, but not large enough to afford costly, custom software employed by giant brands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/simbaware.com\/\">Simbaware<\/a> is one of the newest in this realm. The startup has created a quality management system (QMS) for small to mid-sized, medical device manufacturers. Now forgive me for a sec while I unleash a flurry of acronyms on you: It\u2019s QMS SaaS for SMBs. To help them meet FDA requirements. FTW!<\/p>\n<p>So many letters. What does it all mean? Settle in for a few minutes because it\u2019s time to learn something. First, the good news for anyone needing a medical device is that the FDA does not let companies just make them willy nilly.<\/p>\n<p>Nope. Turns out you have to meet numerous requirements, and then report to the FDA that you did so. A lot of these smaller manufacturers are still using paper records and manual systems to document all sorts of things, from customer complaints to audits to non-conforming materials.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a big risk in terms of non-compliance if there are gaps in your records or things that haven\u2019t been filled out,\u201d says Simbaware co-founder and CEO Manfred Walder. Those small mistakes not only cost companies big dollars in terms of FDA observations, warning letters, recalls and more, but the lack of visibility also allows inefficiencies to thrive.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34072\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34072\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SimbaG4-square-1-500x454.jpg\" alt=\"Simbaware's Bend team includes: Benjamin Dorning, business analyst; Manfred Walder, co-founder and CEO; and Dan Hill, vp sales and marketing. \" width=\"500\" height=\"454\" data-wp-pid=\"34072\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SimbaG4-square-1-500x454.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SimbaG4-square-1-768x697.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SimbaG4-square-1-1024x929.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/SimbaG4-square-1-800x726.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Simbaware&#8217;s Bend team includes: Benjamin Dorning, business analyst; Manfred Walder, co-founder and CEO; and Dan Hill, director of sales and marketing.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Walder co-founded Simbaware last year as a way to affordably streamline and improve the quality processes for \u00a0medical device companies with 50 employees or less. Turns out there&#8217;s nearly 10,000 of them. He says that much of the software on the market focuses on giant medical device companies \u2013 think Medtronic or GE \u2013 and is very expensive and complex.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo those solutions are usually out of reach,\u201d says Walder, who has spent much of his career working in quality management for large manufacturers. \u201cAt the other end of the spectrum, the QMS systems mostly lag and only cover parts of the quality system \u2013 they\u2019re very limited in how they can be configured to meet the customers\u2019 specific needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34073\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34073\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-34073\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MainDashboard-1-500x268.png\" alt=\"Simbaware dashboard\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" data-wp-pid=\"34073\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MainDashboard-1-500x268.png 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MainDashboard-1-768x411.png 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MainDashboard-1-1024x548.png 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MainDashboard-1-800x428.png 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MainDashboard-1.png 1841w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34073\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Simbaware dashboard<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>And we&#8217;re back to that oft-ignored middle (related: my younger sister maintains that middles are routinely forgotten. Like left in the driveway as the whole family goes to the airport). Simbware is still in early days. They completed the first version of their software in December, and then ran a pilot program with a medical device company for the first half of this year. The co-founders discovered that their solution can save manufacturers 3% to 4% of their revenue via efficiency improvements, avoidance of FDA observations and recalls and reduction in loss of revenue.<\/p>\n<p>The company has four employees. Simbaware\u2019s Director of Sales and Marketing Dan Hill (formerly of Drink Tanks and Oregon Bioscience Association) is now reaching out to potential customers, introducing the product and garnering even more feedback.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on saturating the west coast, rolling the product out and then moving across North America,\u201d Hill says. The startup is also one of the semi-finalists\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/bvc-announces-26-semifinalists-for-early-stage-growth-and-social-impact-competitions\/\">BVC early stage competition<\/a>.

Walder notes one of his co-founders, Emmanuel Nyakako, grew up in Kenya and wanted to use the Swahili word for lion in the company name. \u201cWe searched domains, Simbaware was available\u2014so it worked out,\u201d he says. Hopefully, we\u2019ll hear this startup start to roar in the near future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a few tech companies in Bend building enterprise SaaS products for businesses in that mysterious middle: Too big [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":34072,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[61,15],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34065"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34065"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34065\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":34075,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34065\/revisions\/34075"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34072"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34065"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34065"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=34065"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
