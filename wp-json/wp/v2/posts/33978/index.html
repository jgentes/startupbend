Interested in the maker movement, he found a maker space in his then home of San Diego and wanted a project that would help him to learn how to use all of the equipment. Tyrone had been fascinated by the Rubens&#8217; Tube &#8212; a flame tube that demonstrates acoustic standing waves &#8212; since studying physics in college.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought what if I could create a desktop version that you put music through,&#8221; he said this morning, sparking the first concept for the Fireside Audiobox. He didn&#8217;t initially envision that his project would turn into a business, but people were really interested in the product &#8212; and wanted to know when they could buy their own flame dancing speaker.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-33978-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/ksr-video.imgix.net\/projects\/908566\/video-690124-h264_high.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/ksr-video.imgix.net\/projects\/908566\/video-690124-h264_high.mp4\">https:\/\/ksr-video.imgix.net\/projects\/908566\/video-690124-h264_high.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div>\n<p>The fire speaker functions much like a camping stove, but with less heat and pressure. It comes with a full-range speaker driver and uses a\u00a0standard 16.4-ounce propane cylinder that feeds a row of 15 flames.The flames move to different heights, responding to the changing frequencies and volume of your favorite tunes.\u00a0The burning question that you&#8217;re probably asking <em>right now<\/em>: How do the flames respond to Shaggy? I&#8217;m going to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Additional features of the Fireside Audiobox include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizable:\u00a0<\/strong>The lightweight, self-contained audio system stands 19.5 inches high, 14 inches wide and 4.5 inches deep. While the standard version comes donning bamboo, customized hardwood finishes are also available to complement your home d\u00e9cor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Bluetooth-Enabled:\u00a0<\/strong>With its built-in Bluetooth technology, users are able pair the Fireside Audiobox with any Bluetooth-enabled device for easy music streaming.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Battery-Powered:\u00a0<\/strong>More than eight hours of constant play from the included rechargeable on-board battery and power\u00a0adapter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Tyrone aims to raise $35,000 via the Kickstarter campaign. The funds will help start Fireside Audiobox&#8217;s production and distribution, which Tryone aims to do in Bend. The Fireside Audiobox starts at $349 for the first\u00a0101 backers, with price going up for backers later to the party.<\/p>\n<p>This month is shaping up to be a busy one for Tyrone, who is also a realtor with Cascade Sotheby&#8217;s. In addition to the fundraising campaign, Tyrone is pitching the Fireside Audiobox as one of four finalists in Portland&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/designmuseumfoundation.org\/portland\/blog\/2016\/05\/12\/product-pitch-party\/\">Product Pitch Party<\/a>\u00a0on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>The PPP is a &#8220;shark tank style event for the makers of Portland.&#8221; And I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;re biased over here, but I am saying that the Fireside Audiobox does pair two of greatest things ever created by humans &#8212; music and fire &#8212; into one product. That&#8217;s a high bar people.
