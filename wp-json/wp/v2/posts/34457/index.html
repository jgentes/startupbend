Developing those soft skills begins with an awareness and understanding of who you are as an employee\u2014what you already offer, how you\u2019d like to grow and how you\u2019re connected to your work. With that understanding, you can better develop and apply essential networking and communication skills that are authentic to you and most impactful to your professional growth and success.<\/p>\n<p>Central Oregon tech company leaders and the Technology Association of Oregon have partnered with East Cascades Workforce Investment Board to offer this foundational professional development opportunity in a commitment to building a robust and skilled tech workforce to support the anticipated and ongoing growth of the industry.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Topics that the summit will cover include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>21st Century Work Culture &amp; Trends<\/li>\n<li>Starting with WHY<\/li>\n<li>Professional Development Competencies<\/li>\n<li>Effective Networking Skills<\/li>\n<li>Managing Work Flow: Distractions, Asking for Help, Inquiry &amp; Advocacy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Seating for this event is limited, so the organizers encourage you to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techoregon.org\/events\/tech-talent-development-summit-bend\">register asap<\/a>.
