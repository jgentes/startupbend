The inaugural class of 16 is about halfway through the summer digital marketing course. Following is a guest post (courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/web.bluebirdstrat.com\/blog\/bendpoly-a-real-world-education\">Bluebird Strategies&#8217; blog<\/a>) from Alex Spearman, a senior from Hawaii Pacific and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendpoly.com\/\">BendPoly<\/a> student, about what&#8217;s she&#8217;s learned so far.<\/p>\n<p>I recently read a stat on job opportunities for recent college grads. The numbers are bleak;\u00a0more than four out of five students are graduating college without a job.\u00a0And sure, there are many factors lending themselves to this reality, including the economy and an\u00a0ever evolving\u00a0job market, but the stats also beg the question: When I graduate will I have the marketable skills needed to land a job?<\/p>\n<p>This last point has stuck out to me in my college experience the most. I am a senior, graduating in December, and I have found myself concerned that I have little job market know-how or any real, hands-on work experience. I can tell you the anatomy of a leaf and can quote Shakespeare, but can I walk into an interview and prove my value to a company with a particular skill set? Uh, no, not really. Is this because colleges are, in essence, failing their students by not providing more technical, vocational type skill sets? I believe so. There is only so much theory one can learn before it becomes practically useless when not applied with\u00a0real world, hands on\u00a0experience.\u00a0BendPoly\u00a0was created to help change that and it\u2019s what immediately drew me to this class and experience.<\/p>\n<p>BendPoly meets three days a week, for five hours in a conference room in the newly built\u00a0Tech Center\u00a0in Bend. The Tech Center is energizing with its silicon valley feel and open floor plans; you feel important merely being there. I appreciate the fact that we are in a work-like environment, sitting around a conference table not only learning from veteran, industry professionals and thought leaders, but contributing and engaging with one another, as well. This inaugural class of 16 students, ranging in age, background and experience, each brings a unique value to the classroom that feels fed by the energy and structure of the class itself. More than one time, I found myself just sitting back, in awe of my fellow classmates and their critical thinking, eagerness to learn and ambition.<\/p>\n<p>As we enter week three,\u00a0it feels like we have learned as much as students do in four years of college.\u00a0The only difference is we are being taught something that is not being taught within the walls of our universities;\u00a0a real, tangible skill and expertise.\u00a0The class was constructed to bridge the gap between higher education and the\u00a0work force, giving us, the students, the opportunity to learn a marketable skill. This in turn will allow us to enter the job market, not only with our\u00a0degrees,\u00a0but with a vocation that is applicable and highly sought after by employers today. And honestly, I&#8217;m not sure there is another program that allows 16 students to learn digital marketing from the creators and innovators of digital marketing.<\/p>\n<p>In closing here are a few highlights for me from the past three weeks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jon Miller, co-founder and\u00a0all around\u00a0digital marketing guru (my words, not his), was our keynote speaker the first day of class. Mark this under things other students probably haven\u2019t gotten to say, either. His presentation had some\u00a0remarkable takeaways\u00a0that set up the class well. His insight was\u00a0eye-opening, inspiring and overall, pretty darn cool.<\/li>\n<li>I had a personal\u00a0fan girl\u00a0moment over\u00a0John Dempsey,\u00a0social\u00a0strategist with\u00a0Wieden + Kennedy. My background is advertising and to even be in close proximity to a person who works for Wieden and Kennedy had me stumbling over my words and asking a million questions. He was gracious, patient and had tons of industry knowledge as it relates to social media and digital marketing.<\/li>\n<li>And lastly,\u00a0getting to know and working with this group of dynamic and brilliant students\u00a0has been a privilege, to say the least. I am a firm believer that you must surround yourself with others much smarter than you to be able to learn and grow and that is exactly where I find myself at BendPoly. I am relishing being the small fish in a big pond and learning from each my peers. We have some truly astounding people coming out of this class and each of them is about to take the world by storm.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-32699 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/alex-250x250.jpeg\" alt=\"alex\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/alex-250x250.jpeg 250w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/alex.jpeg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Alex Spearman is a motivated, enthusiastic and driven strategic communication undergraduate student with a passion for the advertising and marketing industry.
