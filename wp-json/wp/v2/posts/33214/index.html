I Do (Also: Kollective and LeadMethod are Hiring)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Humor me and harken back to the early 2000s for a moment. We had just moved to town and my soon-to-be husband was hoping to find a tech job in Bend. He looked (unsuccessfully) for a couple of years while working remotely and we ultimately moved back to the Puget Sound. Bend had won our hearts, but the reality was we couldn&#8217;t stay &#8212; not if we wanted to progress in our careers.<\/p>\n<p>Consider that\u00a0at that point,\u00a0G5 had yet to be founded. Kollective was 15 years away from opening an office here. And the BVC, Seven Peaks and Cascade Angels didn&#8217;t exist. I cried the entire way up I-5 and we spent the next decade plotting how to move back.<\/p>\n<p>So when I scan the jobs board each week, I can officially say: We&#8217;ve come a long way baby. I&#8217;m so excited for the tech and startup community that&#8217;s growing here, and for the opportunities available to current and aspiring Bendites for solid, career-advancing, good-paying jobs <em>in Bend<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>You might see just a job opening. But what I see is a chance for another person or family to create a life they want in a place they love. Believe me, that&#8217;s harder than it sounds. Now to bring this story full circle, the software company my husband later started is hiring right now, right here.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33216\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33216\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bend.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33216\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/bend-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Love these mountains.
