Cairn and Free Range Backpacks are both based here, while Homeschool is out of Portland.<\/p>\n<p>From the BOW news release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>At the core of the program is the mentorship from BOW\u2019s industry founders in areas where developing companies may be lacking. Through a process of discovery meetings, analyzation and curriculum building, BOW determines company needs and provides guidance from the founders and extended mentor group. The incubator then supports these companies by aligning them with additional resources needed to succeed, including legal assistance, financial planning, marketing, logistics, sales, marketing, and product development.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>BOW was conceived by Gary Bracelin, a long-time Bend resident and outdoor industry expert. He&#8217;s joined by\u00a0Eric Meade, Rick Fredland, Justin Rae, Will Blount and Howard Allred. The six founders represent various skill sets and a multitude of experience with successful organizations.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s more on their newest startups:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Slackline Technology <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Redmond-based Slackline Technology was born in the Bivouac Campground at Smith Rock State Park in May 2013. Founder Jason Fautz, along with friends and athletes, was constantly frustrated with equipment available for longline and highline rigging, so began manufacturing slackline specific hardware while diving deeper into safe rigging practices. The company has incorporated many of the ideas used by climbers\/climbing gear manufacturers (light, strong, specific yet versatile) to create two unique slackline-specific products with many more on the back burner.
