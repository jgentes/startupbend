He moved to Oregon a year ago and launched StartupCamp.com, an educational membership program\u00a0for aspiring entrepreneurs to benefit from his experience, start successful companies, and live a balanced life. Partridge aspires to be the\u00a0Dave Ramsey of startup coaching, all from the\u00a0StartupCamp.com studio here in Bend. BendTech recently sat down with Dale to learn more.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><strong>Startup: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/startupcamp.com\/\">StartupCamp.com<\/a><\/div>\n<div><b>Started:<\/b>\u00a0January 2015<\/div>\n<div><b>Founder:<\/b> Dale Partridge<\/div>\n<div><b># of staff:<\/b> 5 part-time<\/div>\n<div><b>Headquarters and Studio:<\/b>\u00a0Bend<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><b>Why did you decide to launch startup camp?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Launching a company can be very difficult. It takes fanatic discipline, consistency, and a learner\u2019s heart. At\u00a0Sevenly, I had everything an entrepreneur wants, a huge paycheck, a slick HQ, people calling you to invest. I also\u00a0made tons of mistakes that cost jobs, millions of dollars, sanity, and sleep.\u00a0When I left Sevenly, I stepped back for a year and processed my experiences by writing 227 articles\u00a0and\u00a0my book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/People-Over-Profit-Purpose-Successful\/dp\/0718021746\">People Over Profit.<\/a> I want to teach people how to build the right business\u00a0that allows them to work to live, instead of being the wealthiest lonely person\u00a0clocking 80 hours a week.\u00a0So many startups today fail because they are not disciplined. Entrepreneurship is\u00a0for finishers, it&#8217;s a character driven process requiring\u00a0discipline and consistency.\u00a0Additionally, StartupCamp is designed to show students the right shortcuts and possible\u00a0blind spots to save years of guessing and mistakes.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0df96f1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32641\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0df96f1.jpg\" alt=\"0df96f1\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0df96f1.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/0df96f1-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><b>What\u2019s the offer to your students?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>We provide 12 modules, which each include\u00a0a 30-minute\u00a0coaching video, PDF curriculum pack,\u00a0study guide, checklist, recommended reading, supplemental content, freebies, podcasts, and shows. The plan is\u00a0to get your idea to launch at month five, and thriving by the end of the year. There\u2019s also a private\u00a0Facebook group where I answer 10-15 questions per day, and Q&amp;A conference\u00a0calls. For people who successfully get through the course, there&#8217;s a certificate\u00a0and graduation. The program costs\u00a0$99 a month\u00a0or $949 upfront for the year.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><b>How is it going so far?\u00a0<\/b><b>How do you measure success?\u00a0<\/b><\/div>\n<div>I think we are almost going to be known as an incubator. \u00a0We already have over 300 students. With so many people jumping into e-learning, quality and design are core to our business, with solid outcomes. Good design tells people you care about them, and it takes a serious entrepreneur to know that. Dave Ramsey has results, that\u2019s why he grows year after year. I\u00a0am fanatically focused on results\u00a0and students are already starting businesses and making money. It\u2019s\u00a0really cool to see.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><b>Why Bend?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Bend has got a bright future.\u00a0It\u2019s a micro economy like Hawaii,\u00a0a unique island in the middle of Oregon. You can make an impact here. You can know every startup in Bend. I hope to be a voice and leader for startups here for the foreseeable future\u00a0and help people not just chase their dreams, but actually build companies. I\u2019m going to have the StartupCamp Summit every year in Bend at a campground I\u2019m planning to buy and event\/office space downtown.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div><b>What\u2019s next?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>I\u2019m figuring out\u00a0what happens for alumni, including extended courses,\u00a0getting more people in the doors and keeping them there.\u00a0Eventually, I want to keep this company the\u00a0right size and have five to seven full time employees with a one million per employee annual revenue target. It\u2019s not huge like Sevenly, but\u00a0people forget how much a million dollars is. I\u00a0plan to keep things at the right level so I can be the best dad and husband possible. I want to own my business, not the business to own me, and I want StartupCamp students to\u00a0achieve the same thing.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You probably already know Dale Partridge, founder and former CEO of Sevenly,\u00a0from EDCO\u2019s PubTalk, TedXBend, or even a recent appearance [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":189,"featured_media":32641,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[61],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32635"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/189"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=32635"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32635\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":32649,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/32635\/revisions\/32649"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/32641"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=32635"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=32635"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=32635"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
