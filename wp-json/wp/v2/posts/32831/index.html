Bend Design, Swivel and Bend Venture Conferences Fill Packed Week"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Clear your calendars friends. Because the second full week of October is shaping up to be a quick succession of Bend conferences focused on creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>The week begins with the marketing conference <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swivelnow.com\/\">Swivel<\/a> (formerly Bend Webcam). It ends with the <a href=\"http:\/\/bendvc.edcoinfo.com\/attend\/bvc-agenda\/\">Bend Venture Conference<\/a>. And now the inaugural <a href=\"http:\/\/benddesign.org\/\">Bend Design Conference<\/a> will squeeze right in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>The timing of the design conference is of course by design. Organizers say they wanted to capitalize on the momentum of the week and dovetail their event with the others, recognizing the common themes (as we noted creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship\u00a0<em>and<\/em> words purposely missing vowels) connecting all three.<\/p>\n<p>Presented by Scalehouse, the first-ever design conference is scheduled for Wednesday Oct. 14 and Thursday Oct. 15 and features a range of local and national experts on everything from tiny houses and green building to web and product design and interactive media.<\/p>\n<p>The speakers include Sam Stubblefield, who\u00a0has created art, architecture and other projects for Amazon, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google and Microsoft Research, and Chris DeWan, design director at Second Story, which has studios in Atlanta, New York and Portland.\u00a0You can register now &#8212; students receive a discount.<\/p>\n<p>The 12th annual Bend Venture Conference also kicks off Thursday Oct. 15 with seminars, the unConference and an evening networking event. The companies vying for investment will then make their presentations Friday, Oct. 16 at the Tower Theater. The application deadline recently passed and we&#8217;re excited to hear who will be presenting on the big stage.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, because we saw that open spot in your schedule and we think you should never sleep and\/or make time for laundry, the BendFILM festival is the preceding week. As one organizer suggested, it&#8217;s a regular Bend by Bend West.<\/p>\n<p>So to review your October calendar looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bendfilm.org\/news\/\">BendFilm Festival<\/a><br \/>\nOctober 8 through 11<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.swivelnow.com\/\">Swivel<\/a><br \/>\nOctober 12 and 13<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/benddesign.org\/\">Bend Design Conference<\/a><br \/>\nOctober 14 and 15<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendvc.edcoinfo.com\/attend\/bvc-agenda\/\">Bend Venture Conference<\/a><br \/>\nOctober 15 and 16<\/p>\n<p>Nap<br \/>\nOctober 17<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Clear your calendars friends.
