The app that aims to make buying and selling things on social networks easier is up and running with five Facebook groups, including the popular Bend Girlfriend Swap, which has thousands of members.

The app currently (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.handsel.co\/\">give it a try<\/a>) lets users post things to sell in specific groups or across several groups; you can search posts and communicate with buyers and sellers.<\/p>\n<p>The startup celebrated its launch with friends and users of the app at a party last week. &#8220;It was fun to celebrate how far we&#8217;ve come,&#8221; Scofield says.<\/p>\n<p>Though she had the idea years ago, Scofield and co-founder Dave Mullen <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50startups-can-the-handsel-change-how-you-sell-things-online\/\">ramped up Handsel last fall<\/a>, introducing the concept at the Bend Venture Conference.\u00a0They&#8217;ve since moved their operation out of Scofield&#8217;s kitchen and into an office in BendTECH (woot!) and have a team of five, which includes some part-time people and an intern.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, Scofield says the Handsel team\u00a0is working on developing a payment function, creating a freemium model for revenue and fundraising.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_32619\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-32619\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/handsel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-32619\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/handsel-500x333.jpg\" alt=\"Handsel co-founder Molly Scofield far right; Holly Sheerer, admin of Bend Girlfriend Swap; and Jennifer Houston, founder The Red Balloon Project. \" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/handsel-500x333.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/handsel-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/handsel.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-32619\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Handsel co-founder Molly Scofield far right; in the middle is Holly Sheerer, admin of Bend Girlfriend Swap; and left is Jennifer Houston, founder The Red Balloon Project.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Handsel, one of our #50startups, has had a busy spring.
