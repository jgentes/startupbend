There&#8217;s Just 8 Spots, So Sign Up"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>For the second year in a row, the Bend Fall Festival will feature a section of booths dedicated to local startups. Last year, several startups took the opportunity to show their products and concepts to the 40,000 people that flood downtown for the two-day event.<\/p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s Bend Business Showcase will feature 8 startups. Jim Kone, the showcase organizer, is offering a booth to startup founders for $150 for the weekend, which is Oct. 5th through 7th. A canopy is providers. Founders just need to bring whatever they&#8217;d want to fill up a small booth.<\/p>\n<p>The festival is a mix of arts, crafts, businesses and food vendors all filling up the downtown blocks. It&#8217;s very &#8220;fall&#8221; with caramel apples and kettle korn and beer. The latter is also very summer, winter and spring. But I digress.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in securing a spot at the festival, contact Jim at\u00a0businesshorizon@gmail.com.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/EDpVRPFK5bjfq\" width=\"480\" height=\"268\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Time to come out from under your leaf pile.
