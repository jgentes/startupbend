And BlueBird Strategies recently offered a great example. The Bend-based\u00a0BlueBird Strategies is a\u00a0marketing automation and demand generation firm that serves fast-growing tech companies, including established firms and venture-backed startups. You might also know BBS&#8217;s CEO Cari Baldwin as the chief instructor at BendPoly.<\/p>\n<p>This month, <a href=\"http:\/\/web.bluebirdstrat.com\/blog\/bluebirdsgiveback-in-big-ways\">each of the the Firm&#8217;s regional teams <\/a>(Bend, Boise, Michigan and San Francisco) all chose a nonprofit to support and volunteered a day of their time. Here in Central Oregon, the BlueBird staff from Bend and Portland hosted a holiday party for 175 kids (that&#8217;s a lot of kids!) at the\u00a0Boys and Girls Clubs of Bend. They made hot cocoa, decorated cookies and watched the Polar Express.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was truly a great day and it was obvious what a huge impact the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs make on these kids lives and how special something as simple as hot cocoa and cookie decorating is to these kids,&#8221; says Gina Miller, best practices\u00a0and strategy consultant for BBS and board member of the Boys and Girls Club. The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bgcbend.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Boys and Girls Clubs of Bend<\/a>\u00a0offers kids ages 5-18 programs, focused on academic success, healthy lifestyles and character and citizenship at its two locations.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_33310\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33310\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BGC_BlueBirders.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-33310 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BGC_BlueBirders-500x375.jpeg\" alt=\"BGC_BlueBirders\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BGC_BlueBirders-500x375.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BGC_BlueBirders.jpeg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-33310\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BlueBird staff Pierce Heska, Gina Miller, Amie Brown, Hana Jacover and Cari Baldwin help out at the Boys and Girls Club.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The company also chose a charity, Direct Relief, and made donations in their clients&#8217; names.
