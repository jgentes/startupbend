The event &#8212; literally a tour of various Bend tech companies plus tacos, beer and an after party &#8212; is scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 19.<\/p>\n<p>First, if you have\/work at a local tech company, you can still sign up to have your company be one of the tour stops. Here&#8217;s how it works: The event kicks off at BendTECH at the 1001 Tech Center building with tacos, beer and a chance to meet and mingle with BendTECH startups, members and tech tour participants.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you get to walk\/drive\/uber\/lyft\/bike to nearby tech companies and learn more about what they do. Then after the tour &#8212; there&#8217;s an <em>after party (<\/em>Is\u00a0anyone else singing Ignition Remix right now? Just me?). The after party will be at Oregon Spirit Distillers.<\/p>\n<p>What to expect: Last year, there was a whole host of job hunters and people new to the Bend tech and startup community. It was an awesome chance to meet people, and also learn more about some companies you hear about a lot and others that you may not know of.<\/p>\n<p>The Bend event is part of a week-long TAO Tech Tours around the state. So this year, there may also be some out-of-towners who are going between Eugene, Portland and Bend to see what&#8217;s going on. You can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techoregon.org\/events\/2017-tao-tech-tours\">sign up here or learn more about how to be a tour stop<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Hope to see you there.<\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/4SKb1pQHYFdSw\" width=\"480\" height=\"271\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/jaye-tyler-4SKb1pQHYFdSw\">via GIPHY<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tech Tours is coming back to Bend this year.
