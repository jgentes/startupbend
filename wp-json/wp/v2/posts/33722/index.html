Baldwin, who is also founder and CEO of digital marketing firm BlueBird Strategies, says the program may be in multiple locations in 2017, including back in Bend.<\/p>\n<p>Sixteen students completed the 2015 course, and Baldwin says that 70% of the eligible graduates landed digital marketing jobs shortly after (including a hire here at Kollective). The mission of the program is to provide college students and recent graduates with practical digital marketing skills that augment their degrees and offer them experience that helps them get hired.<\/p>\n<p>Baldwin notes that this summer\u2019s course is longer than last year. It includes five weeks of classroom instruction and three weeks of project-based work. The instructors again hail from notable Oregon and Silicon Valley companies, and include Geoffrey Moore, author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream\/dp\/0060517123\">Crossing Chasm<\/a> (a book you find on many startup founders\u2019 bookshelves) as well as digital marketers from the Portland Trailblazers.<\/p>\n<p>This summer&#8217;s BendPoly program also covers new topics including agile project management and devotes more days devoted to learning Marketo software. The latter company is a contributor to the program. The 2016 BendPoly course at GFU is already full.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Baldwin and BendPoly founder Bruce Cleveland, a Bay Area venture capitalist and Bendite, stay in close contact with their first cohort as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard back from students who are getting hired,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re saying thank you and that they couldn\u2019t have (gotten hired) without what they\u2019ve learned from BendPoly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Good luck to this year\u2019s class!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BendPoly is taking its program on the road and heading to George Fox University this summer.
