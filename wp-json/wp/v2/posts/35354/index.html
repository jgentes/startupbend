But when auction items go for less than what their donors hoped\u2014or don\u2019t capture the audience\u2019s attention at all, then everyone misses out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were working on fundraising projects and having conversations behind closed doors about how we\u2019re leaving money on the table with auction items,\u201d says Talena Barker, a former nonprofit fundraiser and founder and CEO of Bend-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.missionlimelight.com\/\">Mission Limelight<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge? Most charity auction donations come from local donors, which don\u2019t inspire high bidding because they aren\u2019t new or unique to the local audience, Talena says. Thus, packages sell for far less than value, fail to excite guests and leave auction donors less than happy.<\/p>\n<p>In trying to make the most of every auction, Talena found a creative workaround. She\u2019d call like-minded nonprofits in other places and trade auction items in hopes of garnering bigger donations for them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe started setting up these informal exchanges,\u201d Talena recalls. It took a lot of legwork, but the results\u2014better auction items bringing in bigger donations\u2014were worth it.\u00a0Talena was certain that someone would turn this good idea into a company.\u00a0Turns out, that person was her.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A marketplace for good<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Talena and Lisa Shropshire, the startup\u2019s Director of Outreach, have 30 years of nonprofit fundraising experience between them. They started Mission Limelight in January 2017, and have been in whirlwind of startup activity since.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35355\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35355\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35355\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017RiverFeast-4728_preview-500x333.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017RiverFeast-4728_preview-500x333.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017RiverFeast-4728_preview-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017RiverFeast-4728_preview-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017RiverFeast-4728_preview.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35355\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lisa and Talena with Mission Limelight.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Just a few of their milestones: Being chosen as part of the first cohort of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.xxceleratefund.com\/\">XXcelerate Fund&#8217;s accelerator program<\/a>. Pitching Mission Limelight on the Bend Venture Conference stage as a concept stage finalist. And launching their product the same day.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s Mission Limelight actually do? \u201cThe best way for people to understand how the product works is HomeExchange.com,\u201d\u00a0Lisa\u00a0says. At its\u00a0first level, the startup creates an\u00a0exchange-based\u00a0marketplace for donated auction items\u2014a place for nonprofits to\u00a0mutually\u00a0search for\u00a0and trade\u00a0the best items for their auctions.<\/p>\n<p>At the second level: Companies who regularly donate items can note their offerings on the Mission Limelight platform. Then nonprofits can search the inventory and select things that they think their audience would love.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Building a marketplace<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Mission Limelight win-win? Nonprofits end up with unique auction items that bring in higher donations. For companies, the platform reduces the work of fielding numerous asks for donated things,\u00a0and are able to target their giving in a way to support their marketing efforts. Instead, they load their offerings into the platform with any\u00a0philanthropic or advertising demographic\u00a0parameters and then direct fundraisers that way.<\/p>\n<p>With the increasing emphasis on corporate responsibility, Talena and Lisa say the next phase of Mission Limelight will be to help companies improve the tracking, understanding and reporting on their giving.<\/p>\n<p>Building a marketplace comes with its own challenges. Talena notes that at the beginning you face a chicken-egg situation, with nonprofits wanting to join once the companies have and vice versa. That said, Mission Limelight has 18 clients and counting.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35356\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35356\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35356\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Early-Stage-Finalists-BVC-500x375.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Early-Stage-Finalists-BVC-500x375.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Early-Stage-Finalists-BVC-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Early-Stage-Finalists-BVC.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35356\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mission Limelight as one of the BVC early stage finalists.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Go big and do good<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For 2018, the startup is focused on getting more nonprofits into their system.
