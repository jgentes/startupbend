We&#8217;d love to write a story about each one of these things, but as part-time news hounds, we were falling behind. And we want to keep you in the know. So here is a high-level glance at some of the exciting things happening in our tech and startup community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seven Peaks opens a Seattle office<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bend&#8217;s own Seven Peaks Ventures has expanded northward. The VC firm announced this week that Seattle startup veteran and investor Dave Parker has joined their team. Even more interesting: Parker is opening a Seattle office of Seven Peaks, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2017\/tech-moves-dave-parker-open-new-seven-peaks-seattle-office-uber-adds-microsoft-vet-lead-seattle-recruiting\/\">focusing on seed and Series A funding for startups in the Seattle area,&#8221; according to Geekwire<\/a>. Congrats to the SVP team on their continued growth, and to increasing the connection between the Puget Sound (my previous home for a dozen years) and the High Desert.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New Innovation Center for Entrepreneurship director has arrived\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/adamkrynicki\/\">Adam Krynicki<\/a>, the first director of OSU-Cascades Innovation Center for Entrepreneurship, has landed in Bend from Alaska, where he was deeply involved in all things startup-y, from working as the director of technology and energy for Alaska&#8217;s SBDC to his position as the vice president of Nanook Tech Ventures, which facilitated the creation of startups from IP developed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. We had the chance to briefly meet, and we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing Adam around more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kollective and Manzama are moving to Northwest Crossing <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Bulletin reported earlier this week that tech companies Kollective and Manzama will be moving into a new building in Northwest Crossing, part of a three-building campus that is anchored by HydroFlask. Kollective has been in the 1001 Tech Center building since the company moved from the Bay Area in 2015, but has outgrown its current space. The company said the new space will hold up to 40 employees. Manzama is moving from its offices downtown. Also reported in the Bulletin: That same campus may house a Thump\/Fearless Baking shop.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cascade Angels giving away a Bend Venture Conference ticket<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ICYMI: Bend&#8217;s own regional angel fund is giving<a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/want-to-win-a-bvc-ticket-and-a-julieselfie-cascade-angels-is-having-a-contest\/\">\u00a0away a ticket to the Bend Venture Conference,<\/a> valued at $299!

The sixth annual unConference is planned for Oct. 17th, and currently sponsored by Kollective and the City of Bend. There will be 20 spots for people to pitch, the audience votes and the winners get cold, hard cash to further their business idea. Put it on your calendar. It&#8217;s the best. More details to come.
