For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rodriguez, with Bend-based Axiology, has created beautiful cosmetics from ingredients that are vegan and cruelty free.<\/li>\n<li>Doherty draws on her experience working with nonprofits to help for-profit businesses find ways to deepen their own social impact.<\/li>\n<li>Pool&#8217;s latest venture, Besso, partners with breweries across the globe to up-cycle spent barley grain into plant-based superfood smoothies.<\/li>\n<li>Keith, with Sudara, offers living wage jobs and resources to women in India who have escaped sex slavery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We&#8217;ll discuss the experience of these entrepreneurs as well as how more of us can integrate our own values and causes more closely with our work, even if we don&#8217;t plan on starting a company or changing careers.<\/p>\n<p>Join us!<\/p>\n<p>Event:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/theworldmuse.org\/muse-conference\/\">Muse Conference Salon Series<\/a><br \/>\nSocial Impact Businesses<br \/>\nFriday, March 3<br \/>\nLiberty Theater Downtown<br \/>\n9:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.<br \/>\nCost: $10<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/theworldmuse.org\/muse-conference\/\">Register here<\/a> and check out the salon discussions throughout the day as well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have some time Friday morning, then head to the Muse Salon Series at the Liberty Theater downtown for [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34489"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=34489"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34489\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":34491,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/34489\/revisions\/34491"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34489"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34489"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=34489"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
