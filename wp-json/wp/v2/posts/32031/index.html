Navis is aiming to hire more than two dozen tech positions &#8212; including 9 developers &#8212; by the end of May. The company makes reservation and marketing automation software for the hospitality industry, and they\u2019re growing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.navisresorts.com\/\">Navis<\/a> currently employs 280 people, with about 200 of those positions right here in sunny Central Oregon. The software company also has offices in Tempe, Ariz. and Orlando, Fla.<\/p>\n<p>Doug Spencer, Navis\u2019 new CTO, says Navis is expanding into new, international markets as well as developing new products. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re staffing up,\u201d says Spencer, who recently moved to Bend from Los Angeles, where he was previously the CTO of the International Logistics Division of G4S.<\/p>\n<p>Navis&#8217; clients are mostly independent hotels and resorts and vacation rentals. While independents comprise about one-third of the U.S. market, they account for the majority of the international hospitality markets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big market that we\u2019re still not touching,\u201d Spencer says. He also envisions mobile apps of Navis products, something that will take the company\u2019s dev team in a new direction.<\/p>\n<p>Gregg Daub, Navis\u2019 recruiter, says that in the past the company has relied mostly on Visual Basic development on a .NET technology stack. But developing new products and internationalizing their current ones means Navis is bringing sexy stacks back (I literally could not help it).<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 452px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.crushable.com\/files\/2012\/09\/justin-timberlake-singing-10b.gif\" alt=\"why Justin Timberlake should make new music singing gifs\" width=\"452\" height=\"220\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">To my knowledge, JT doesn&#8217;t work at NAVIS. But maybe you could &#8230;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This requires developers with a wider range of skills including familiarity with Open Source coding, Linux and other front-end applications like Angular and Node.js, as well as MongoDB and Hadoop on the back-end. In addition to developers, the company is on the hunt for QA and network engineers.<\/p>\n<p>Which now brings us to the big question tech companies here often face: Where do you find technical talent? Daub acknowledges it\u2019s not easy. But Navis salaries are competitive, and he\u2019s touting Bend\u2019s lifestyle to techies up and down the West Coast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe definitely have a great place to sell in Bend, and the company has been listed by The Oregonian as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.navisresorts.com\/media\/news-events\/press-releases\/2014\/09-15-2014\">Top Workplace in Oregon<\/a> three years running ,\u201d he says.
