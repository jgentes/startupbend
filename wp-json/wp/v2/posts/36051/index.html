Why That&#8217;s Important and What&#8217;s Next."},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>You&#8217;re likely familiar with the gender pay gap. Well, there&#8217;s also a very real and very large gender investment gap when it comes to startup founders who receive funding. It&#8217;s one of the statistics that you keep waiting to see improve, and it doesn&#8217;t really budge much from 2% &#8212; that i<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2019\/01\/28\/funding-female-founders-2018\/\">s 2% of all investment dollars go toward women founders<\/a>.  Far, far less goes to women of color. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an issue that&#8217;s both global and local. To be sure, we&#8217;ve seen some individual success stories. A couple examples: Lora Haddock, founder of Lora DiCarlo, raised $1.1 million last November for her innovative sex toy company. And Rita Hansen, CEO of Onboard Dynamics, has raised several million for her cleantech startup. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for every woman founder who has raised, there are dozens more stories of founders who struggle to get noticed. They g<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2017\/06\/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get\">et asked different questions by often mostly male investment firms<\/a>. The <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/work\/1372702\/female-founders-and-investors-are-finally-breaking-up-the-ultimate-boys-club-in-silicon-valley\/\">VC world remains between 82% and 91% male<\/a>, according to different studies. The article I just linked to notes that whole landscape is complicated, but even as there&#8217;s been some exciting developments in the world of funding aimed at women, there&#8217;s still an insanely long way to go. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve interviewed many, many female founders who have great ideas, solid experience, and need the important fuel of capital to really light up their company. Nearly to a one, they have crazy anecdotes about their fundraising experiences, their rare encounters with women investors, their ideas for women-focused products that male investors don&#8217;t quite get. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/03\/01\/business\/female-founders-venture-capital.html\">proven ways to get more women funded?<\/a> <em>Get more women involved with investing. <\/em>Research shows that when women do the investing, more women get funded. Which brings me to an exciting local project that a couple of us are working on (thanks to Teri Hockett and Talena Barker) called <em>Invested<\/em>. The idea is simple: To introduce more women here in Central Oregon to startup and angel investing, provide education in a private, informal setting, and connect them &#8212; if they&#8217;re inclined &#8212; to local funds such as BVC, Cascade Angels, Founder&#8217;s Pad, and more that already doing great work supporting Oregon startups. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing is way to make a powerful difference in your own community. And before we get too far, yes, it can 100% be about making money. But it can also be about supporting your community in an innovative way. As an investor, you can: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Support a business that positively impacts our community or society or drives innovation that makes a difference in an area you care about. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Promote more women in leadership and create a business world that looks more representative of the real world. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Earn a potential financial return, which helps build wealth for you, your family and your community.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2018\/02\/14\/what-is-an-accredited-investor.aspx\">accredited investor<\/a>, nearly accredited, wondering what accredited means, or not there yet, but maybe someday in the future, and you&#8217;re interested in learning about investing in startups and the many ways of doing so, then we&#8217;d love to meet. <br><br>As a first step, we&#8217;d like to assess your interest. Then we can gather as a private group, plan our curriculum (there&#8217;s a whole lot of great resources), and hopefully activate even more awesome angels in our community. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your participation is confidential, and no commitment is required.
