We provide digital release of liability waivers to more than a 1,000 businesses including gyms, yoga studios, preschools, trampoline parks and sports leagues. We make the waivers easy to use and sign. We can collect and analyze data from the waivers for our customers. And we spend on a lot of time on integrating hardware, the iPads and kiosks that the customers of our clients\u2019 use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Complete this sentence: We\u2019re like the _______ of\/for _________ (<a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50startups-meet-stridebox-a-subscription-box-for-runners\/\">Birchbox for Runners<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/articles\/50startups-meet-bend-based-amplion-research\/\">Kayak for Biomarkers<\/a>). <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re like the MailChimp for waivers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspired your company? <\/strong>Andy and I had a previous business, and Major League Baseball contacted us to create a digital waiver. We told them to go find one, and they came back and said they couldn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t believe them, but after hunting around ourselves, we didn\u2019t see anything like a digital waiver either. That was about three years ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aren\u2019t there other companies that do digital documents? <\/strong>Sure, but they\u2019re not designed to do what we do. They usually target individual documents for individual users. Smartwaiver is designed for having tens of thousands of people sign the same thing. We provide digital waivers for the NFL Super Bowl Experience, Nascar\u2019s Inside Track events and BCS bowl game festivities.<\/p>\n<p>We really focus on the usability and efficiency of the waiver signing process. Throughout the year I like to visit our customers and observe how people are using Smartwaiver. It&#8217;s amazing the insight you gain by stepping out of the office and watching your product being used in the real world. For example, a popular bar gathers hundreds of digital waivers for their mechanical bull ride each night and was struggling with using the keyboard at their Kiosks. I went down there to see why it was an issue and discovered that people were actually stealing the keyboards! So we were able to offer an alternative and suggest it to other customers.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31491\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31491\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144236.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31491\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144236-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"These guys.

But since then we\u2019ve been growing fast with little traditional advertising. Most of our customers find us via word-of-mouth or they see the name of our company on the waiver. This is the fastest I\u2019ve ever gone to profitable with any of my businesses. We were in the black at 18 months. And we\u2019re growing fast. We\u2019ve had more than 3 million people use our waivers.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31492\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31492\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144324.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-31492\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144324-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"Smartwaivers! \" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144324-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144324-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144324-800x450.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31492\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smartwaivers!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>What lessons have you learned? <\/strong>It always takes you longer than you think. Also it\u2019s important to keep it simple across the board, but especially with your product. I\u2019ve definitely lost profit in the past by making more and more stuff to add to the product. Sure there\u2019s all types of features that people would love, but keep the goal simple.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next for Smartwaiver? <\/strong>We\u2019re focusing on handling incoming customers. Customer commitment and service is a big part of what we do. We provide real-time customer support through a chat box on our site as well as a phone number. Every person here does customer support. I also routinely read through all the chat logs to see what people are asking about and figure out how we can improve.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A random fact that will blow people\u2019s minds:<\/strong> I\u2019m a longtime big wall climber. I used to do a lot more before I had kids. I now have three daughters. The biggest wall I\u2019ve climbed was 2,000 feet high. It took me 10 hours to go up, and another eight to come down. I think big wall climbing is the best school for entrepreneurs&#8211;it teaches you to deal with stress and how to take calculated risks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then there&#8217;s this &#8230;\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144347.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-31490\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144347-500x281.jpg\" alt=\"20140925_144347\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144347-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/20140925_144347-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Should you ever find yourself inside Smartwaiver&#8217;s offices you&#8217;d be hard pressed not to notice the paintings of rock chucks wearing costumes and set in scenes from World of Warcraft, Star Wars, etc. I&#8217;m not gonna lie: They&#8217;re mesmerizing.
