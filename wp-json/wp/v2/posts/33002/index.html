For the next two days, our not-so-little mountain town will be brimming with entrepreneurs, investors, startup experts, people who have already made it to the business <em>Big Time<\/em> and people who are just still working to get there.<\/p>\n<p>This is my third year attending the BVC and I thought I&#8217;d offer up a little advice for how to make the most of Northwest&#8217;s largest angel conference.<\/p>\n<p><strong>First, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/articles\/6th-annual-bvc-unconference-adds-speed-networking-event\/\">today&#8217;s unConference<\/a>.<\/strong>\u00a0Presented by a little blog you might know, and hosted at BendTECH, the unConference is just that: an informal meetup of startup geeks that ends in an all-out pitch fest. It&#8217;s free. There&#8217;s beer. And the person with the winning pitch will present as part of the early stage company presentations at the BVC Friday. It&#8217;s pure entrepreneurial enthusiasm. Ideas and energy run amok, in a good way.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2105_unconference_900w.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-32953\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2105_unconference_900w-500x249.jpg\" alt=\"2015 BVC unConference\" width=\"500\" height=\"249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2105_unconference_900w-500x249.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2105_unconference_900w-800x399.jpg 800w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2105_unconference_900w.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bring a sweater.<\/strong> I&#8217;m not your mom (surprise!). But the Tower Theater will be packed Friday. So get there early and bring something to save yourself a seat, like a sweater or perhaps a light jacket.Then you can go have a muffin and morning mingle, knowing that you&#8217;ll have a prime place to seat come show time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t skip lunch.<\/strong>\u00a0For at least three years, but probably way more, the BVC has organized an dine-around-town lunch scenario. After a morning of presentations and facing an afternoon of more, you might be tempted to sneak off during the noon hour and do some work. But you&#8217;d regret it. It&#8217;s a great time to meet people, and the groups that coalesce for lunch are always an interesting mix. And now I am sounding like your mom, BUT you never know who you&#8217;ll be eating next to you or what might come of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Smile at the presenters.\u00a0<\/strong>For the most part, the founders on stage are still early in their entrepreneurial journeys. They&#8217;re passionate about their companies. They&#8217;ve been working hard on their presentations and Friday they&#8217;ll need to get on stage and sell the living daylights out of their businesses, all while answering questions from the panelists and theater full of people. It&#8217;s no small feat. And it takes a lot of guts. So give them a smile and let them know you get it &#8212; or at least pretend.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy the conference. Come say hello at the unConference and snag some StartupBend schwag. We&#8217;ll be tweeting and blogging our way through today and Friday, using #BVC2015.
