For those us still in the throes of holiday shopping, consider gifting some of these fun products from local Bend startups:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Granola from Birdseed Food Company.<\/strong> Do you have a health conscious friend in your life? Someone with celiac? Or someone who simply appreciates great food? Put together an array of treats that includes granola from <a href=\"https:\/\/birdseedfoodco.com\/\">Bend-based Birdseed Food Company<\/a>. Found Ashley Chase started the company after being diagnosed with celiac and looking for granola that was not only gluten-free, but sugar-free as well. Not finding any, she created some&#8211;and the result is a crunchy kasha-based granola that people rave about.\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_35240\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-35240\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35240\" src=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/birdseed-375x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/birdseed-375x500.jpeg 375w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/birdseed-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/birdseed.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-35240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Birdseed Food Company<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li>\n<li><strong>Bedphones from DubsLabs.<\/strong> If your special someone likes listening to music or even white noise while he or she falls asleep, then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dubslabs.com\/bedphones-3\/\">Bedphones are the perfect present<\/a>. Founder Eric Dubs invented these over-ear headphones, which allow people to drift off to their favorite sounds without the discomfort of an earbud stabbing into their ear.
