Linux doesn\u2019t need to be rebooted periodically to maintain performance levels. It doesn\u2019t freeze up or slow down over time. Network friendly, Linux is flexible and can be used for high performance server applications, desktop applications, and embedded systems. Linux has free office programs that are totally compatible with Microsoft Office. The upgrade schedule for the Linux operating system is painless, free and easy.\u00a0 Fast and easy installation: Linux distributions come with user-friendly installation and setup programs.
