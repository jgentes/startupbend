For a monthly membership fee lower than the\u00a0usual co-pay, we deliver one to four medicines and a blood pressure monitor straight to your home. You also get a personal site to record your\u00a0readings\u00a0and manage your prescription. This system connects to your doctor&#8217;s office through our technology platform DyrctAccess. The physician orders the prescriptions during the patient&#8217;s office visit, allowing them to leave office and have all elements of treatment sent directly to their home without any extra effort. Additionally, the information from the monitors can be shared with their doctors to stay in contact and keep on top of their care. We also work to develop combined therapies, such as putting two common hypertension drugs into one single-dose pill.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And what is DyrctAcess?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DyrctAxess is the patented technology that powers programs like bpCareConnect. This technology allows physicians to order medications directly through us and eliminates resellers. This allows us to sell at a lower price\u00a0with fixed cost structure, which allows physicians to be concrete with a patient about true costs. DyrctAxess supplies multiple medications, not just the ones\u00a0we manufacturer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where did the idea come from?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Through years of work in the pharmaceutical sector, we identified a strong opportunity to lower the cost structure associated with medication distribution.\u00a0We have shown dramatic increases in patient compliance and persistence in our first year. By eliminating barriers to medication adherence, fixing costs for patients and providing them the white glove support they deserve, we have seen over 90% of our patients stay on medication month over month.\u00a0 For providers, outcomes improve when patients adhere to treatment plans.\u00a0 Additionally, we are the only platform\u00a0that helps\u00a0providers see their patient&#8217;s progress when they&#8217;re not in the office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does this help the pharmaceutical sector? <\/strong>Yes.\u00a0Pharma companies are better able to understand how to help patients and providers with the data collected through prescription processing, shipment and patient response.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you funded?<\/strong>\u00a0 Private investors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?<\/strong>\u00a0 Launching our newly approved product.
