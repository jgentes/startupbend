But FireWhat, a new startup in town, aims to limit some of that destruction by mapping fires, developing technologies to track responders, and ultimately make the fire fighting process more efficient. \u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Unless you are kicking it old school with\u00a0a handwritten\u00a0dead-tree map, most of the maps we use today on smartphones, computers, and even printed, are a result of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We can use\u00a0a GIS like Google Maps to find our way around, but there\u2019s an advanced\u00a0level\u00a0of the field that can do much more. <span style=\"color: #333333\">GIS basically\u00a0makes the world a complex quilt of data\u00a0that can be analyzed and put to good use in decision\u00a0making\u00a0and planning.\u00a0<\/span>BendTECH sat down with FireWhat\u00a0CEO Sam Lanier to learn how they are applying GIS and expert-sourced information to improve fire fighting and why they&#8217;re expanding in Bend.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/burnout.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-32009 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/burnout.jpg\" alt=\"burnout\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><strong>Startup:<\/strong> Firewhat<\/div>\n<div><strong>Started:<\/strong> Jan 4th, 2011.<\/div>\n<div><b>Founders:\u00a0<\/b>Sondra Suazo, Jeremy Orozco, Ryan Avila, and Sam Lanier<\/div>\n<div><b>Employees:\u00a0<\/b>6 Fulltime Employees, and 4 Seasonal Staff.

We&#8217;re looking to expand operations in the coming months.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>So what does FireWhat do?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;re a technology company that provides custom tools to map and track assets in and out of the field. We aim to correct the antiquated delivery of information to our nation\u2019s first responders.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>Where did you get the idea?\u00a0<\/b>FireWhat came about after several road trips around the world. We all worked in different areas of Emergency Response throughout the Western United States and realized there had to be a better way to share information so the same mistakes weren\u2019t repeated amongst responders.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In 2011, the company made a major shift in development, and focused it&#8217;s attention on the need to provide better wildfire information to the public. We launched our first mobile application, a Google and WeatherUnderground-based app fed by our information. Then in 2013, we acquired the rights to Wildlandfire.com, the largest database\u00a0for expert-sourced wildfire info, and started our relationship with Esri. Our main goal is to geospatially\u00a0enable wildfire data on the web\u00a0so it can be used by\u00a0anyone.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32003\" src=\"https:\/\/bendtech.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/firewhat-app-500x410.jpg\" alt=\"firewhat-app\" width=\"500\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/firewhat-app-500x410.jpg 500w, https:\/\/startupbend.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/firewhat-app.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>Can you talk about your Esri partnership?<\/strong>\u00a0Shortly after the purchase Wildlandfire.com, we were fortunate to be selected as an Esri Startup Partner and\u00a0began the rapid revamp with a full integration of Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Online GIS platform. The online mapping platform provides measurable\u00a0success in the wildfire community.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>How are you funded?\u00a0<\/b>We garner revenue from a several places including ad space on Wildlandfire.com, mobile application development, and contracts with the government for our GIS mobile labs for emergency response to natural disasters. We&#8217;re also contracting wildfire data distribution to other types of companies including media, weather and timber businesses.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>Are you raising money?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Yes, FireWhat is in the process of starting its next round of financing.<\/div>\n<div><b>What are some of your challenges?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>Being based in Dunsmuir has been a godsend for the team. We are able to keep our costs way down. But to the contrary, we are limited on finding local tech developers. This is a big reason we are expanding our reach into Bend.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>How you making use of Unmanned Aerial Systems?<\/strong>\u00a0We worked closely with our city to apply to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for permission to test unmanned aerial systems for wildland firefighting and search and rescue. Our request was approved last August. Now we&#8217;re working to partner with a UAS platform that flies at high elevation, for long periods, and has\u00a0extended range. This is extremely important for our industry and will be an evolutionary change\u00a0in wildfire management.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>What&#8217;s next?<\/b><\/div>\n<div>We are in a\u00a0rapid growth phase. With growth comes increased demands on the team, and the need to raise additional capital to meet contract requirements.\u00a0We\u2019re\u00a0working on technologies that speed the process of mapping emergency incidents with the use of GIS and looking forward expanding to Bend.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On average more than 100,000 wildland fires burn 4 to 5 million acres a year in the United States.
