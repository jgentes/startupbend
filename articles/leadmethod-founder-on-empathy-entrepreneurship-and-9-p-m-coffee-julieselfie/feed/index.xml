					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] LeadMethod Found and CEO Justin Johnson says, &#8220;You’ve got to have a lot of empathy when working with employees, investors, customers, advisors and just about everyone else you work with. They’re in it right along with you. This is not a solo game; you will not have all the answers, and the minute you think you do there is a problem. Be confident, but listen (really listen) to the people working with you, supporting you and those who have been there before. Trust me, your business will go a lot farther and faster if you do.&#8221; [&#8230;]]]></description>
