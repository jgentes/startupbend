					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/top-10-startupbend-posts-of-2015-reveal-lots-of-startup-activity-see-who-made-the-list/#comment-1928&quot;&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello! Yep Navis has been around awhile. I don&#039;t really think of them as a startup, but I&#039;m happy to include their news on our blog as part of the tech community. I&#039;m a big &#039;ol fan of Bend&#039;s women entrepreneurs. We&#039;ve covered many of them on the blog, including Molly Scofield with Handsel, Elicia Putnam with Prestobox, Rita Hansen with Onboard Dynamics, Julia Junkin with JUJU, Chez Brungraber with Gobi Gear, Lisa Sipe with FoodFu and more. The list in this post reflects the blog posts that had the most readers over 2015 per our site stats. Sorry if that was confusing. Changed the headline to make it more clear. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Navis has been in business since 1987....seems like a stretch for &quot;startup activity&quot;....no? Also there are so many amazing female entrepreneurs in Bend! Where are all the female founders and firms on this list?]]></description>
