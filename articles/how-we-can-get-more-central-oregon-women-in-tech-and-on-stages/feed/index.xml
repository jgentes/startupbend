					<description><![CDATA[I would not have signed up for this Ignite thing if left to my own devices. To say I am in introvert would be an understatement. Fortunately, I was not left to my own devices — Diane Allen pushed me. She encourages all of her students to get out there and do things — so here I am. I also have lots of things to talk about — I could come up with 10 good Ignite talks on a moments notice at this point because — my wife Kathy Hoyt teaches creativity workshops(Fuse Creativity Consulting) and I’m immersed in it (to the point where people tell me things like “Mike, I just don’t understand how your mind works”). When I took Diane’s Public Speaking for Leaders class — she had us do exercises where we mined our past for good stories and experiences that could be pulled together as-needed for talks, and it turns out I can connect lots of interesting things into a story. She also had us practice doing off the cuff talks and a supportive environment. It was awesome! So — I would encourage anyone — male or female — to start now and work on creativity and public speaking. It won’t hurt, it will probably be a lot of fun, and you may find that when the next TEDx or Ignite event comes around, you’re rarin’ to go with something. You may find it to be a life changing experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week I had the opportunity to work with the 36 incoming eighth-graders who attended the AAUW&#039;s Tech Trek camp held at OSU Cascades. The goal of our session together was to supply them with tools so that they could stand tall within and speak with impact. The girls had to rate themselves on how they felt about speaking in front of a group. Their choices were 1.  I would rather sleep with snakes. 2.  It&#039;s OK. I will do it if I have to.  3.  Move over Taylor Swift! There were about 3 girls ready to kick Taylor Swift off stage. At least 10 who would rather sleep with snakes and one who bolted from the room crying. The rest seemed to be in the I&#039;ll do it but it&#039;s awkward phase. If these girls aren&#039;t supported to stand in their power, over the years the outcome becomes what Kelly described so well in this post.]]></description>

Dave -- sounds like you&#039;re a great employer, and the kind we need more of. Thanks for raising the bar and working hard to create a workplace where all your employees thrive. Unfortunately, and I wish it weren&#039;t so, but the statement you highlighted has been substantiated many times over (see the associated links in the copy).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Suggest that broad and unsubstantiated statements such as &quot;...the issue entails everything from institutionally sexist workplace cultures to historic biases regarding women and STEM careers to the lack of confidence our girls have in their math and science capabilities.&quot; are not especially helpful. As a male who has worked his entire career in tech,  and founder of two Bend companies, I work very hard to be ethical and treat ALL employees fairly and equally.]]></description>
