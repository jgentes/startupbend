					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] The Social Impact Track debuts at BVC next Thursday. There are four awesome companies pitching, including Bend&#8217;s own Sudara. I&#8217;m pretty excited to be on the panel, hear more from these inspiring founders and take part in this cool new track aimed at funding for-profit companies that also have a social/environmental mission. Hope to see you there. [&#8230;]]]></description>
