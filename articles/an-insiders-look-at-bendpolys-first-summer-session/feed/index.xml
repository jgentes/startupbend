					<description><![CDATA[Great post Alex! As a fellow BendPoly student, I couldn&#039;t agree  with you more. This program is addressing a real pain point for recent or approaching college grads. While I don&#039;t regret the time and effort I spent obtaining my college degrees, I am thrilled and grateful to be getting the extra polishing that BendPoly is providing in terms of hands-on applicable learning, networking opportunities and job placement support. BendPoly is a beacon of light for the future!]]></description>
